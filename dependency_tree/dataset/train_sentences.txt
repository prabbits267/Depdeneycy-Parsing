Al - Zaman : american force kill Shaikh Abdullah al - Ani , the preacher at the mosque in the town of Qaim , near the syrian border .
[ this killing of a respected cleric will be cause we trouble for year to come . ]
DPA : iraqi authority announce that they have bust up 3 terrorist cell operate in Baghdad .
two of they be be run by 2 official of the Ministry of the Interior !
the third be be run by the head of a investment firm .
you wonder if he be manipulate the market with he bombing target .
the cell be operate in the Ghazaliyah and al - Jihad district of the capital .
although the announcement be probably make to show progress in identify and break up terror cell , I do not find the news that the Baathists continue to penetrate the iraqi government very hopeful .
it remind I too much of the ARVN officer who be secretly work for the other side in Vietnam .
Al - Zaman : guerrilla kill a member of the Kurdistan Democratic Party after kidnap he in Mosul .
the police commander of Ninevah Province announce that bombing have decline 80 percent in Mosul , whereas there have be a big jump in the number of kidnapping .
on Wednesday guerrilla have kidnap a cosmetic surgeon and he wife while they be on they way home .
in Suwayrah , Kut Province , two car bombs be discover before they could be detonate .
( Kut be in southeastern Iraq and have a overwhelmingly shiite population , who be on the lookout for Baathist saboteur and willingly turn they in .
this willingness be the main difference in the number of bombing in the south as oppose to the center - north of the country . )
in Baghdad Kadhim Talal Husain , assistant dean at the School of Education at Mustansiriyah University , be assassinate with he driver in the Salikh district .
guerrilla kill a engineer , Asi Ali , from Tikrit .
they also kill Shaikh Hamid 'Akkab , a clan elder of a branch of the Dulaim tribe in Tikrit .
he mother be also kill in the attack .
two other Dulaim leader have be kill in the past week and a half .
one of they be from the Jubur tribe and be deputy commander of the Hawijah garrison .
two hundred member of the Batawi clan of the Dulaim demonstrate in Baghdad on Friday , protest the killing of they clan elder , Shaikh Kadhim Sarhid and 4 of he son , by gunman wear iraqi army uniform .
( this be a largely sunni arab clan , and some sunni observer have accuse shiite element in the government of be behind the assassination ; it be more likely the work of sunni arab guerrilla punish the Batawi leader for cooperate with the Dec. 15 election . )
the commission say it have no legal grounds for such a exclusion .
this item be a small one and easily miss .
but in my view it be highly significant .
the Debaathification Commission have be push by Ahmad Chalabi and he Iraqi National Congress very hard , and have push many sunni Arabs into the arm of the guerrilla .
Chalabi have be increasingly marginalize within Iraq , however , despite he tie of clientelage with Washington and Tehran .
some 2,000 junior officer of the old Baath army have be recall to duty in recent month , something Chalabi would have block if he could have .
now the Electoral Commission be refuse to punish people for mere past Baath Party membership .
the situation in Iraq be only go to get better this way .
if someone commit a crime against humanity , prosecute the person .
if he or she do not , then they should have all the same rights as other Iraqis .
Al - Sharq al - Awsat report that a key eyewitness in the trial of Saddam Hussein for a 1982 massacre at Dujail have die .
a team from the court manage to take he deposition before he die .
the trial begin again Nov. 28 .
in Baghdad the fighting still continue in several area , mostly in Sadr city and Adhamiya .
Baghdadis do not venture much out of they neighbourhood any more , you never know where you might get stuck .
there have be talk that the night curfew might be implement again .
my neighbourhood have be surround by american troops for three day now , helicopter have be circle over we head non-stop .
fedayeen be now visible on the street and they have become bolder than ever .
yesterday there be ten of they put road block on we street and set up mortar , they only come out in the open when Americans leave the area , then they start fire mortar indiscriminately and shoot they ak - 47' in the air .
they be set the road block at the exact same position they be during the war last year , which indicate they be the same people .
and there be nothing we can do about it really , people who be suggest that we go out and fight they be live in dream land .
even the IP and ICDC have abandon the neighbourhood , and those be trained and armed , so do not expect scared civilian to do anything except to hide inside and pray a helicopter or a tank do not bomb they , and also how be american soldier go to distinguish the brave and valiant civilian from the fedayeen ?
everyone be apprehensive , there be some talk that April 9th and 10th be go to be bloody day .
most people have not go to work the last few day , although it seem that the rest of Baghdad be ' normal ' ( if you can define what normal be ) .
there be rumour about preparation by slum dweller for another looting spree against bank , governmental and public property similar to the one that take place last April , and I have already overhear youngster in my neighbourhood joke about it and say thing like " this time we will be the first to loot , we do not get anything the last time " .
mosque be call for donate blood , food , and medicine for Fallujah , and several convoy have already head out for Fallujah , most of they return later though .
so what happen ?
I guess it be just the old new arab ' I against my brother , I and my brother against my cousin , I and my cousin against my enemy ' , or ' the enemy of my enemy be my friend ' thing go on again .
speak of Fallujah , we have only Al - Jazeera to rely on for we news from there .
they have send over they top reporter Ahmed Mansour to the town , and he be spout all kind of propaganda hourly remind I of Al - Sahhaf .
" they be targett ambulance " , " american sniper be shoot child and pregnant woman " , and " they be use cluster bomb against civilian " be all you get to hear from he .
he do once make a unforgivable error when he mention that fallujan militant be shoot at the Marines from the roof of mosque and house in Hay Al - Golan , but of course that be okay for Al - Jazeera .
Al - Iraqiyah tv say that ICDC be control Ramadi .
Azzaman newspaper mention a announcement sign by Abdul Aziz bin Muqrin , a Al - Qaeda operative in Saudi Arabia on a islamic website ' the voice of Jihad ' , in which he state that " although mutilate dead body be not originally permit in Islam , but in this case it be allow if Muslims use it against infidel to deter they from commit criminal action " .
he add that " America do not understand anything except the language of force and retaliation , they be kick out of Somalia in humiliation after that soldier be drag in Mogadishu for the whole world to see " , and that " the day will come when the dead body of Americans and Jews would be drag , defile , and step on in the Arabian peninsula together with they agent and supporter " .
Elena 's motorcycle tour through the region around Chernobyl have revive interest in one of the most serious nuclear disaster in history .
we all know what happen , but even to this day , there be many different version and opinion on how it happen and what effect Chernobyl will have on the health of people affect by the fallout .
now you can tour Chernobyl and write you own story .
this be not a post about fault - finding or assign blame .
it be a time to learn what happen and how it may affect the future .
this be heavily promote by the Australasian Radiation Protection Society in a press release title the MYTHS of CHERNOBYL which contain the follow :
one of the most widespread myth of recent time be that the Chernobyl nuclear reactor accident in 1986 cause many thousand of extra cancer death in neighbour region , and that public health have be severely affect by exposure to radiation .
many people still believe that to be true , even though the Ministry of Russian federation on Civil Defence , Emergencies and Elimination of Conseguences of Natural Disasters ( EMERCOM of Russia ) report this in 1996 :
CHERNOBYL accident : ten year on
the prestigious IAEA ( International Atomic Energy Agency ) publish a early report on Chernobyl which be base on information from russian source and state that there be no significant health effect .
however , in April 2001 , the IAEA publish Fifteen Years after the Chernobyl Accident - Lessons learn . which contradict the earlier report .
here be some excerpt :
the dramatic increase in radiation - induce thyroid cancer in child and adolescent in Belarus , Russia , and Ukraine , which have be observe since 1991 , continue to this day .
... a drop in the birth rate , a deterioration in woman 's reproductive health , a increase in complication during pregnancy and birth , and a deterioration in neonatal health ....
as a parent , I can well imagine how painful it must be for those family whose child be succumb to radiation poisoning .
there be a lot to learn about Chernobyl .
be well - inform will give you certainty and that be desirable in a world of conflict report .
there be a wealth of reference on Chernobyl .
read some of the follow link and draw you own conclusion .
these link present the many viewpoint that exist and still exist about the disaster call Chernobyl :
IAEA report Lessons learn
I would be interested in hear what conclusion you reach and what you find that be most convincing .
as a child in the 50' I have a lot of glandular problem and they treat it with radiation therapy ( primitive at best ! ) and stop when a lesion on my neck start enlarge -- they say it be not ca but stop the treatment ....
remember the old shoe size machine that be a form of radiation xray ?
that too be stop .
do not have to mention what radiation have do and be still do to Hirsohima & Nagaski folk -- there can be no doubt about the effect of radiation in Chernobyl .......
the Chernobyl Children 's Project ( http://www.adiccp.org/home/default.asp ) offer several way to help the child of that region .
one of they be the Rest and Recuperation Program , wherein a child can come to the US for a few week in the summer .
even a little time spend receive wholesome , uncontaminated food , good medical care , etc. can add year to they life .
S. and I have a acquaintance who have host several of these child for many year ; to see these little one break the heart .
the urge to protect and gather they all in be almost overwhelming , and make I more grateful for the blessing I have .
take care , my friend , Linda
I be sorry to say Elena 's story have be reveal to be a fake .
what do the new al - Qaeda videotape and audio speech of Bin Laden and Ayman al - Zawahiri tell we about the hope of the remaining top leadership of the organization ?
because the US and Pakistan have manage to capture or kill about 2 / 3 of the top 25 al - Qaeda commander , the middle manager be not in close contact with al - Zawahiri and Bin Laden .
the tape be a way to signal priority .
these be 1 ) assassinate or overthrow Gen. Pervez Musharraf , the pakistani military " president " who have make a coup in 1999 and have throw in he lot with the United States against the Taliban and al - Qaeda .
Musharraf have be try to purge he officer corps of the substantial number of al - Qaeda sympathizer .
he military intelligence have capture major figure like Abu Zubayda and Khalid Shaykh Muhammad , as well as nearly 500 other al - Qaeda operative , over 400 of whom the Pakistanis have turn over to the US .
MMA also capture the Northwest Frontier Province , which probably shelter Bin Laden and al - Zawahiri , and be in a joint government of Baluchistan Province , also on the Afghanistan border .
if al - Qaeda can kill Musharraf or instigate a military coup against he by Islamist junior officer , they can hope to catapult the MMA to power as political ally and host .
they would thereby gain control of a major base for terrorist operation , which be also a nuclear power .
all this be highly unlikely , as with most al - Qaeda crackpot scheme .
but so be it unlikely that a small group of arab mujahidin would virtually take over Afghanistan .
response : the US must do whatever it can to strengthen the legitimacy of the pakistani government .
on the other , restriction should be lift on the mainstream Muslim League - N and Pakistan People 's Party , who can defeat the MMA in fair election if not hogtie by the secret police .
on the other hand , the US should strong - arm India and Pakistan into a final settlement of the Kashmir issue .
Al - Zawahiri attempt to use Musharraf 's lack of progress in help the Muslims of that indian state as a justification for he overthrow .
2 ) target Israel and encourage the worst element of the Palestinians by play on the iron fist policy of the Sharon government .
response : the US have succeed in politically isolate Hamas , and start the process of cut off its funding .
this terrorist organization can now only pull off far less sophisticated bombing and attack .
it should continue to be defange .
3 ) make Iraq another Afghanistan , use the Republican Right 's own tactic against they .
response : Iraq be actually hostile territory for al - Qaeda , and without iraqi sympathizer it can not succeed there .
by move quickly to iraqi sovereignty and improvement of iraqi life , the US may be able to get Iraqis on its side , so that they turn in the foreigner .
certainly , the Shiites already hate al - Qaeda and would help ; likewise the Kurds .
the problem of mollify the Sunnis , though , have to be solve to avoid give al - Qaeda a entrée .
the Americans have to put away they free - market fetishism for a while and find way of create job and pump money into iraqi household .
of course , the sooner the US soldier can be withdraw in favor of less - provocative local or international force , the better .
the thing to keep in mind be that sunni arab nationalist and Baathists and local sunni radical be likely to remain far more dangerous to the US in Iraq than al - Qaeda infiltrator , and it would be dangerous to take one 's eye off the former ball .
George W. Bush allege Thursday that John Edwards lack the experience necessary to be president .
the problem with this argument be that Bush lack the experience necessary to be president when he run in 2000 , so this sort of cheap shot just hoist he by he own petard .
let 's just remember a seminal Bush moment in 1999 :
' Bush fail reporter 's pop quiz on international leader
November 5 , 1999
web post at : 3:29 p.m. EST ( 2029 GMT )
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
Texas Gov. George W. Bush be endure sharp criticism for be unable to name the leader of four current world hot spot , but President Bill Clinton say Bush " should , and probably will , pick up " those name .
the front - runner for the 2000 republican presidential nomination falter Thursday in a international affair pop quiz pose by Andy Hiller , a political reporter for WHDH - TV in Boston .
Hiller ask Bush to name the leader of Chechnya , Taiwan , India and Pakistan .
Bush be only able to give a partial response to the query on the leader of Taiwan , refer to taiwanese President Lee Teng - hui simply as " Lee . "
he could not name the other .
" can you name the general who be in charge of Pakistan ? "
Hiller ask , inquire about Gen. Pervaiz Musharraf , who seize control of the country October 12 .
" wait , wait , be this 50 question ? " ask Bush .
Hiller reply : " no , it be four question of four leader in four hot spot . " . . .
it appear this guy be go to bring stability to the country and I think that be good news for the subcontinent . "
" I find it troubling that a candidate for president in we country -- the world 's oldest democracy -- would characterize the military takeover as " good news , " Gore say .
" further , I find it even more disturbing that he make these comment about a nation that just last year test nuclear weapon -- shortly after voice he public opposition to the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty .
a spokesman for President Clinton also criticize Bush 's comment .
" it be very dangerous for this country to condone the overthrow of democratically elect government , " say David Leavy , spokesman for the National Security Council .
not only do Bush not know who General Pervez Musharraf be , he seem to have confuse coup - making with " take office , " and moreover go on to suggest that the overthrow of a elect prime minister and the installation in power of the Pakistan military , then the world 's strongest supporter of the Taliban , would bring " stability ! "
Musharraf make he coup in part because of the military 's anger over Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif 's willingness to back down from confront India over Kashmir , so that he explicitly come to power as a warmonger .
I can not tell you how ominous I find Bush 's performance in that interview .
I still remember he stutter about " the general , " unable to remember Musharraf 's name .
he obviously like authoritarian rule better than democracy , equate dictatorship with " stability . "
and , he do not think he need to know anything about South Asia , with its nuclear giant and radical religious politics -- the latter a dire security threat to the US .
Musharraf go on to play nuclear brinkmanship with India in 2002 , risk war twice that year .
although Musharraf do turn against the Taliban after September 11 , under extreme duress from the US , element of he military continue to support radical Islamism and have recently be implicate in assassination attempt on Musharraf himself .
this be the body that Bush proclaim be bring " stability " to the region in fall of 1999 .
so , one answer to Bush 's charge about Edwards be that if it have any merit , Bush should have decline to run himself .
this be what Edwards 's campaign literature say about he position : " Edwards believe that the U.S. must be a active leader to help resolve conflict , from reduce tension between India and Pakistan to the peace process in Northern Ireland .
Edwards be a strong supporter of Israel , and believe that the U.S. have a vital role in promote peace between the Israelis and the Palestinians . "
I do not see Bush do any of this .
from Friday 's Daily Star

as the american public gradually weary of the Iraq crisis , some have begin worry that the war could blow back on the US by create the condition for anti-american terrorism .
Israel , however , be much closer to Iraq and be likely to suffer from iraqi instability much more acutely than will the United States .
ironically , among the strongest proponent of war in Iraq be israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon and he neoconservative supporter in the US .
have they , however , actually weaken israeli security ?
the biggest threat Israel face be not from conventional army but from the asymmetrical tactic of palestinian national liberation movement .
the derailing of the Oslo peace process by the hard - line policy of Sharon and the palestinian intifada have encourage suicide bombing .
this , in turn , have discourage international investment in Israel and have make it less likely that immigrant to the country will actually remain there .
although Israel withdraw from lebanese territory in May 2000 , the radical lebanese shiite party , Hizbullah , have not be mollify .
it be estimate to have some 5,000 armed fighter , and they have pursue attack against israeli force to compel they to withdraw from the Shebaa Farms , a sliver of syrian territory that Israel annex after the 1967 war .
any thorough assessment of the impact of the Iraq war and its aftermath on Israel 's security environment must , therefore , closely examine its likely effect on the conduct of asymmetrical warfare .
although it be often allege ( without much evidence ) that Saddam Hussein give money to the family of palestinian suicide bomber and so encourage asymmetrical warfare , it be not clear that he actually pose a danger to Israel .
the Palestinians who have be willing to kill themselves to end the israeli occupation of the Gaza Strip and the West Bank be not drive by economic consideration .
Saddam never do anything practical to help the Palestinians .
at some point , as in the late 1980 , he reportedly make behind - the - scene overture to the Israelis to arrive at some sort of a deal .
he do not allow palestinian radical to launch operation against Israel from Iraq .
by the late 1990 , Iraq have no nuclear or biological weapon program , and have destroy its chemical weapon stockpile .
its ramshackle army have virtually collapse before the american invasion in 2003 .
if it be hard to see how baathist Iraq pose any real threat to Israel , it be not so difficult to see a menace in the current instability .
the bungling of post-war Iraq by the Bush administration create a weak and fail state .
armed militia , many staff by former iraqi military man with substantial training and experience , have proliferate .
the US choose to ally itself with such group as the Supreme Council for the Islamic Revolution in Iraq , whose 15,000 - strong Badr Corps paramilitary be train by the Iranian Revolutionary Guards .
anti-israeli and pro-palestinian feeling be strong among several major iraqi ideological group and current .
the more radical Shiites , who generally follow the theocratic notion of Iran 's Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini , routinely chant and demonstrate against Israel .
they vehemently protest the israeli assassination of Sheikh Ahmed Yassin , the leader of Hamas , last March .
worse for Israel , the assassination draw a denunciation even from the moderate and cautious Grand Ayatollah Ali Sistani , who wield enormous moral authority over iraqi Shiites .
these shiite movement have be suppress by Saddam Hussein 's regime , but have now organize and arm themselves .
they have also reestablish they historical link with lebanese and iranian Shiites .
sunni arab fundamentalist deeply sympathize with the Palestinians and with Hamas , and those in Iraq have deep historical ink with fundamentalist in Jordan and Palestine .
iraqi city such as Fallujah and Ramadi be on the truck route from Amman to Baghdad , and so come under the influence of the Salafi movement , which be popular in Jordan .
secular arab nationalist group also universally sympathize with the Palestinians , and those in post-saddam Iraq be no exception .
whereas Saddam Hussein 's dictatorship ensure that such populist current be keep firmly under control , they be now free to organize .
a Iraq in which armed fundamentalist and nationalist militia proliferate be inevitably a security worry for Israel .
if even a modicum of normality and security can be return to Iraq , its citizen will be able to benefit from the country 's petroleum reserve .
that private wealth can easily be funnel into aid for the Palestinians and for lebanese Shiites .
Israel 's security interest be best serve by peace with its neighbor , which can only be achieve by trade land for peace with the Palestinians .
Ariel Sharon 's aggressive near annexation of almost half of the occupy West Bank and he indefinite postponement of any palestinian state have create unprecedented rage and violence .
the anger have spread throughout the muslim world , include Iraq .
the promotion by the pro-zionist right of twin occupation - in the West Bank and in Iraq - have profoundly weaken , not strengthen , israeli security .

Tamils feel that the propose defense agreement between India and Sri Lanka would encourage sinhala ruler to prepare for another war abandon the current peace process
but there be strong hint in the country that a new indo - Sri Lanka defense deal could be in the making .
and this have already draw protest from the Tamil National Alliance ( TNA ) which be back by the LTTE in the April general election hold in Sri Lanka .
apart from the 1,200 indian life lose in 1987 , the indian peacekeeping force be immensely unpopular not only in Tamil Nadu and the Jaffna peninsula but also among the sinhalese majority who consider it a violation of they country 's sovereignty .
India defensive over Sri Lanka
by Ranjit Devraj
NEW DELHI -
while India be ready to enter into a " defense cooperation agreement " with Sri Lanka , it be wary of be draw into any military involvement in the island nation 's two decade - old civil war that have see violent strife between ethnic Tamils and the sinhalese majority - leave over 60,000 dead on both side .
and that explain the delay in the signing of a formal defense agreement that be at the heart of sri lankan President Chandrika Kumaratunga 's four - day visit to India recently .
accord to Professor S D Muni , South Asia expert at the Jawaharal Nehru University , the two - year peace talk between Colombo and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam ( LTTE ) be stalemate .
" the sri lankan government do not want to initiate a conflict but would be interested in deter the LTTE from start one .
and the Tigers look as if they be on the brink of launch another offensive , " Muni tell IPS .
Colombo hold six round of talk with the Tigers between September 2002 and March 2003 .
but last April , the rebel abruptly pull out of negotiation demand recognition , first , for the right to self - rule before proceed any further .
Kumaratunga 's India tour precede a three - day visit to Sri Lanka by norwegian Foreign Minister Jan Petersen in a new bid to revive the peace talk that be suppose to follow a ceasefire that Oslo successfully broker in February 2002 .
Petersen hold discussion with both Kumaratunga and the reclusive LTTE leader Velupillai Prabhakaran in the rebel stronghold of Kilinochchi without success , and chief tamil rebel negotiator Anton Balasingham and norwegian envoy Erik Solheim hold close - door talk at the international airport late Saturday in a effort to keep the salvage effort on track , diplomatic source say .
but they , too , fail .
Colombo , too , seem to be in a intractable position .
accord to former indian army general A S Kalkat , the difficulty for Kumaratunga 's government lay in the fact that the LTTE have become a de jure power in the north and east of the island and be run every aspect of civil administration in the area within its control .
a veteran of India 's military intervention in the Jaffna peninsula to help implement the 1987 indo - Sri Lanka Peace Accord - which ambitiously provide for the disarming of the formidable LTTE - Kalkat say the new defense deal would essentially be a reiteration of the older one minus its military commitment .
" the Norwegians mean well but they role be limited to that of honest broker and the LTTE be keenly aware that they do not have the power [ unlike India ] to underwrite any arrangement , " Kalkat tell IPS in a interview .
in 1987 , the Tamil Tigers reluctantly accept the peace accord under indian pressure .
under the accord , a new northeastern provincial council be form and the indian army be deploy as peacekeeper in the north and east .
however , difference between India and LTTE soon surface and lead to clash between Tiger guerrilla and the indian peace keeping force .
about 1,200 indian soldier be kill during this phase of the conflict .
India have to pull back its force from Sri Lanka in 1989 follow the election of Ranasinghe Premadasa , a strong critic of indian mediation .
last June , a international initiative lead by Japan to persuade the LTTE to come back to the negotiating table fail despite a aid package offer of us$ 4.5 billion .
Japan 's special envoy , Yasushi Akashi , who call for tangible progress in the peace process before the money would be release , come back from visit to Colombo and Kilinochchi in early November a frustrated man .
he complain about the " visible lack of progress " and reach a impasse in talk with both side .
the Tigers 's chief ideologue , Balasingham , sniff at the proposal say that " a solution to the ethnic conflict can not be predetermine by the resolution or declaration of donor conference , but have to be negotiate by the party in conflict without the constraint of external force . "
but there be strong hint in the country that a new indo - Sri Lanka defense deal could be in the making .
and this have already draw protest from the Tamil National Alliance ( TNA ) which be back by the LTTE in the April general election hold in Sri Lanka .
" Tamils feel that the propose defense agreement between India and Sri Lanka would encourage Sinhala ruler to prepare for another war abandon the current peace process , " TNA member of parliament P Sithamparanathan be quote as say in a statement .
she add that recent visit to the island by India 's top military brass include army chief General Nirmal Chander Vij have " cause apprehension among Tamils that preparation be under way for another war in the island " .
but Kalkat point out that India would be ill - advise to be involved again , militarily , with Sri Lanka if only because it still have to consider the sentiment of 45 million ethnic Tamils in the indian state of Tamil Nadu - separate from Sri Lanka 's Jaffna peninsula by the narrow Palk Straits .
apart from the 1,200 indian life lose in 1987 , the indian peacekeeping force be immensely unpopular not only in Tamil Nadu and the Jaffna peninsula but also among the sinhalese majority who consider it a violation of they country 's sovereignty .
the best option , now , under the present difficult circumstance be for Colombo to do its own dirty work , although New Delhi can always be count on to render good neighborly help because of the share belief that religion , ethnicity and language can not be the basis for secession .
in any case , Kalkat put it succinctly : " there can not be a military option to what be a political situation . "

unreport by the international media , the Valley of Kashmir have see a ethnic and cultural genocide that have result in the fleeing from the valley of almost all the hindu family who have be live there since human habitation be first record .
thus far , none of the many " human rights " busybody across the world have bother to even notice such a development .
Musharraf call the bluff
while most U.S. secretary of state -- save perhaps Dean Rusk -- have gobble up credit for outcome that they have little to do with , few have be as brazen as Colin Powell .
two year ago , pakistani President Pervez Musharraf be surprised when the leader of the main Islamist alliance -- Maulana Fazlur Rahman -- visit India and issue a series of highly conciliatory statement .
as Pakistan 's president have be tell the United States he be " force " into take a hawkish line on India precisely by the likes of Rahman , this be a embarrassment .
the reality be that India be no longer the enemy of choice for the people of Pakistan .
that distinction have now go to the United States .
realist , and this even include member of the U.S. democratic foreign policy establishment such as Strobe Talbott , who have long seek to divest India of its defensive capability against another nuclear power in Asia , understand the only feasible solution for Kashmir be the acceptance of the status quo .
India keep what it have while Pakistan and China ( which be gift a slice of the territory three decade ago ) do likewise .
simultaneously , New Delhi would ensure a degree of autonomy for the state that would help cut popular support off from jihadi attempt to convert Kashmir into a second Afghanistan .
this , Pakistan 's lobbyist in Washington Christina Rocca have be tell , be the " minimum " that the Pakistan army will accept .
it be also far more than what any administration in New Delhi can deliver .
this writer have for year regard the best solution to the Kashmir problem as be the trifurcation of the indian part of the state into a hindu - majority Jammu , a Buddhist - dominate Ladakh and the overwhelmingly muslim Kashmir Valley , with the third state give little of taxpayer 's money but substantial autonomy .
with luck , the Kashmir Valley can attract investment from the Middle East and other location where Muslims be dominant and become a tourist , education and service haven within India .
the overwhelming majority of Muslims in Kashmir would be happy with such a outcome , except for the tiny jihadi segment patronize by the U.S. State Department and the Pakistan Army , which would like to even the score with India for they catastrophic defeat in Bangladesh in 1971 .
unreport by the international media , the Valley of Kashmir have see a ethnic and cultural genocide that have result in the fleeing from the valley of almost all the Hindu family who have be live there since human habitation be first record .
thus far , none of the many " human rights " busybody across the world have bother to even notice such a development .
indeed , they report be fill with tale of the " atrocity " of indian troops on the innocent jihadi .
despite Sept. 11 , the United States still support the Kashmir group that back jihad as part of the price Washington be pay to keep Pervez Musharraf happy .
unfortunately for they , the general have decide to take seriously Colin Powell 's frequent boast that it be on he nudging that the Indians make conciliatory gesture toward Islamabad .
the U.S. State Department and the misname think tank that follow its lead have hold numerous conference on Kashmir and , in most of they , the solution that have emerge be a valley prize loose from indian control and under its own version of Ibrahim Rugova .
that India be not Yugoslavia and that the " foreigner - lead " Indian National Congress can least afford to ignore indian nationalism , have not strike the conferee , among whom have be several indian " scholar " and " analyst " ready to say and endorse anything for the sake of a free trip to New York or Vienna .
it be the business community in India that step in after Vajpayee indulge in a empty bout of saber rattling in 2002 , point out that the only beneficiary of the mythical perception that war -- especially nuclear war -- be around the corner in the subcontinent be China .
the reason for this be that India be emerge as a alternative investment destination to China , hence the favor that the general in Islamabad do to they trusty supplier of nuke and missile by create a scare about war involve India when in fact the real flashpoint be the Taiwan Straits and North Korea .
since then , India have talk peace while always signal that only the status quo would be acceptable as a final settlement : a line of action that be follow in the case of dispute with China as well .
unfortunately for those eager to indefinitely carry on with the lucrative business of conflict resolution in South Asia , Pervez Musharraf have now call Colin Powell 's bluff , challenge he to deliver on he frequent statement imply that the Indians jump to he command .
once the Manmohan Singh government show that it have little appetite for suicide , Musharraf will face the moment of truth : accept the inevitable , or once again ramp up the insurgency and spawn a fresh lot of killer that can hit not merely Mumbai and New Delhi but London and Chicago as well .
the one country that have show that it understand the reality in South Asia be China .
under President Hu Jintao , Beijing have open out to New Delhi and Prime Minister Wen Jiabao be expect to visit early next year , make friend by formally accept Sikkim as part of India and back India as a permanent member of the U.N. Security Council -- thus leave Washington as the only one of the " permanent five " that have not yet do so .

we all know that John Kerry serve in Vietnam .
four whole month , after which he take advantage of a little - know , little - invoke regulation that allow he to desert he " band of brother " .
we also know how Dan Rather libel George Bush and impugn he service in the Texas Air National Guard on a " 60 Minutes ii " report base largely on forge document .
during he time in the Guard , George Bush fly the F - 102 Delta Dagger fighter - interceptor .
the F - 102 see service in the Vietnam theater between March 1962 and December 1969 .
during this time , F - 102 squadron be base out of Tan Son Nhut , Da Nang and Bien Hoa in Vietnam , and Udorn and Don Muang in Thailand .
( click here for source . )
in all this so - call controversy , have anyone consider that perhaps George Bush just want to fly jet ?
and , let 's remember , fly supersonic fighter jet be dangerous !
they do not let just anybody do it .
some reporter ( you know , the one with journalistic ethic ) have actually uncover the truth about George Bush 's service in the Texas Air National Guard .
what follow be the text of a e-mail send to I by a friend of mine ( thanks to Dave Manzano ) .
read on to learn the fact .
Bush 's National Guard year
before you fall for Dems 's spin , here be the fact
what do you really know about George W. Bush 's time in the Air National Guard ?
that he do not show up for duty in Alabama ?
that he miss a physical ?
that he daddy get he in ?
news coverage of the president 's year in the Guard have tend to focus on one brief portion of that time - to the exclusion of virtually everything else .
so just for the record , here , in full , be what Bush do :
the future president join the Guard in May 1968 .
almost immediately , he begin a extended period of training .
six week of basic training .
fifty - three week of flight training .
twenty - one week of fighter - interceptor training .
that be 80 week to begin with , and there be other training period throw in as well .
it be full - time work .
by the time it be over , Bush have serve nearly two year .
not two year of weekend .
two year .
after training , Bush keep fly , rack up hundred of hour in F - 102 jet .
as he do , he accumulate point toward he National Guard service requirement .
at the time , guardsman be require to accumulate a minimum of 50 point to meet they yearly obligation .
accord to record release earlier this year , Bush earn 253 point in he first year , May 1968 to May 1969 ( since he join in May 1968 , he service thereafter be measure on a May - to - May basis ) .
Bush earn 340 point in 1969 - 1970 .
[ in other word , Bush earn enough point to satisfy the requirement for he entire six year hitch in 1969 - 1970 alone .
- acd ]
he earn 137 point in 1970 - 1971 .
and he earn 112 point in 1971 - 1972 .
the number indicate that in he first four year , Bush not only show up , he show up a lot .
do you know that ?
that bring the story to May 1972 - the time that have be the focus of so many news report - when Bush " desert " ( accord to anti-bush filmmaker Michael Moore ) or go " awol " ( accord to Terry McAuliffe , chairman of the Democratic National Committee ) .
Bush ask for permission to go to Alabama to work on a Senate campaign .
he superior officer say ok .
request like that be not unusual , say retire Col. William Campenni , who fly with Bush in 1970 and 1971 .
" in 1972 , there be a enormous glut of pilot , " Campenni say .
" the Vietnam War be wind down , and the Air Force be put pilot in desk job .
in '72 or '73 , if you be a pilot , active or Guard , and you have a obligation and want to get out , no problem .
in fact , you be help they solve they problem . "
so Bush stop fly .
from May 1972 to May 1973 , he earn just 56 point - not much , but enough to meet he requirement .
then , in 1973 , as Bush make plan to leave the Guard and go to Harvard Business School , he again start show up frequently .
in June and July of 1973 , he accumulate 56 point , enough to meet the minimum requirement for the 1973 - 1974 year .
then , at he request , he be give permission to go .
Bush receive a honorable discharge after serve five year , four month and five day of he original six - year commitment .
during he service , Bush receive high mark as a pilot .
a 1971 evaluation call Bush " a exceptionally fine young officer and pilot " who " continually fly intercept mission with the unit to increase he proficiency even further . "
and a 1972 evaluation call Bush " a exceptional fighter interceptor pilot and officer . "
now , it be only natural that news report question Bush 's service - in the Boston Globe and the New York Times , on CBS and in other outlet - would come out now .
Democrats be spitting mad over attack on John Kerry 's record by the group Swift Boat Veterans for Truth .
and , as it be with Kerry , it be reasonable to look at a candidate 's entire record , include he military service - or lack of it .
voter be perfectly able to decide whether it be important or not in November .
the Kerry camp blame Bush for the Swift boat veterans 's attack , but anyone who have spend much time talk to the Swifties get the sense that they be do it entirely for they own reason .
and it should be note in passing that Kerry have personally question Bush 's service , while Bush have not personally question Kerry 's .
in April - before the Swift boat veterans have say a word - Kerry say Bush " have yet to explain to America whether or not , and tell the truth , about whether he show up for duty . "
earlier , Kerry say , " just because you get a honorable discharge do not , in fact , answer that question . "
now , after the Swift boat episode , the spotlight have return to Bush .
that be fine .
we should know as much as we can .
and perhaps someday Kerry will release more of he military record as well .
Byron York be a White House correspondent for National Review .
he column appear in the Hill each week .
one week to election day and the general atmosphere in the capital be eerie , yet strikingly familiar .
I suspect the street of Baghdad will look as if a war be loom this week .
there be no doubt that many Iraqis regard the date of 30 January as a day of renew hope , one they have be await all they life , but at the same time , many other be already dread it .
the interim government have promise security measure that would reduce the violence on the day of election , but I fail to see how they will be able to protect all 5,000 ( or so ) balloting centre .
many voting centre have already be successfully attack or destroy in many area .
now that the picture be clear , the two main compete list seem to be the United Iraqi Coalition list and Allawi 's Al - Iraqiya list .
Ayad Allawi , and other minister run on he list , have quite expectedly use they governmental position in campaigning .
one minister reportedly hand out 100 dollar ' gift ' to journalist attend a press conference for Allawi , a practice that bring back bad memory to many Iraqis .
Sheikh Naji Al - Abbudi , a spokesman for Sistani , affirm the claim that the Grand Ayatollah be back the United Iraqi Coalition list .
indeed , Sistani 's agent all over the country have be quite active in educate iraqi Shia on the merit of election , which have lead to the assassination of at least two of they .
Al - Abbudi state that " he Emminence " decide to openly support the list because " other " ( obviously a reference to Allawi ) have be abuse official state position and media outlet in they campaigning .
again there be no official write statement from Sistani 's office confirm this allegation , which I think be intentional .
Ahmed Al - Chalabi and defense minister Hazim Al - Sha'lan have be engage in shrill public attack over the media .
Chalabi describe Sha'lan as a " Ba'athist " and a " former double agent for Saddam and the CIA " , while Sha'lan dismiss Chalabi as a " thief " and a " iranian stooge who long for he own origin by defend Iran " .
one remark make by Sha'lan on Al - Arabiya TV , that he could not say more about Chalabi because he would embarrass himself and the viewer almost make I roll on the floor .
it be a extremely amusing episode , watch Chalabi look smug and amused , contrast with Sha'lan , all serious and barely keep himself from swear .
fistfight , please .
Hazim Al - Sha'lan , by the way , be the son of the late Sheikh of Al - Khaza'il in Diwaniya and have the potential to replace former information minister , M.S. Al - Sahaf , in he nonsensical media statement , which can be pass as joke .
the main kurdish coalition list ( PUK and KDP ) be barely mention outside the kurdish region .
even there , many Kurds look and act as if they be go to grab the chance to vote they out of power .
I doubt that will be the outcome though .
many Iraqis , include conservative and religious Iraqis , be surprisingly root for the Iraqi Communist party , probably in a attempt to counter the influence of Islamists in the forthcoming National Assembly .
the Communist party have the largest number of register party member in the country and can be consider as the oldest popular political party in Iraq .
its support base be much larger than what it seem .
several candidate be assassinate and target these last two week , other have be force under threat to withdraw and to follow the example of the Islamic party .
sectarian tension be at they highest since April , 2004 , with sunni insurgent now openly attack Husseiniyas and shia mosque .
I have a interesting conversation with a middle - aged taxi driver who use to live in Fallujah and be now at relative in Amiriya , Baghdad .
he describe Allawi 's face as that of a f*ed horse and he dismiss the whole government as a band of thief and traitor .
he say that resistance be the only commonsense solution .
first drive out the Americans , then fight the Shia back into submission ( as in 1991 ) .
sunni Iraqis contend that election be impossible to hold under occupation .
leave aside the fact that this views conflict with other historical example in the region , Sunnis have never offer a alternative choice , which eventually lead one to guess that the opinion hold by the fallujan taxi driver above be precisely what they be plan to implement .
I have another conversation some month ago with a retire Ba'athist old - timer who claim that Ba'athists have the means to stage a third coup d'etat and return to power within 10 hour of a american withdrawal .
on sense my incredulity to he statement he assert that Ba'athist cell exist in all part of the country and that they do have a central command , even though many have form seperate cell ( often under islamic label ) with they own leadership .
he say that they have the training and the funding as well as the support of neighbour and regional government .
I concur that Ba'athists and former security force be capable of immediately control at least 5 out of 18 governorate , along with the capital , if Americans be to be remove from the picture entirely .
but I also see that as a fatal misconception , which be do Sunnis harm , because I do not believe the US be go anywhere so soon .
the only hope now be that , follow the election , the National Assembly would offer the hand of peace and reconciliation to the dissent party .
I would suggest go for tribal sheikh rather than cleric , since they have the upper hand in they area and can effectively root out any Ba'athists in they midst in return for a promise of share power and authority .
many of these sheikh have be disenfranchise and abuse over the last two year .
very recently , US force in Al - Anbar make a terrible blunder by accidentally kill Abdul - Razaq Inad Al - Gu'ud , Sheikh of the Al - Bu Nimr clan from the powerful Dulaym tribe .
Al - Gu'ud have favour election and be in good term with the government .
the Gu'ud family even accept to be offer the seat of Al - Anbar governor some month back .
the Al - Bu Nimr in Ramadi and Al - Qaim rise in arm against Saddam in the mid-ninety follow the execution of Thamir Madhlum Al - Dulaymi , a Air Force general belong to they tribe .
the revolt take two week to be suppress by the Republican Guard .
another bad step be the recent arrest of Sheikh Hassan Al - Lihabi , of the Lihaib tribe which be scatter between the governorate of Al - Anbar , Mosul and Salah Al - Din .
Al - Lihaibi be run in election and be now say to have withdraw follow this incident .
I believe national reconciliation to be the only path forward to a new Iraq .
the Shia can not live without the Sunnis , and vice versa .
both have share this country for the last 14 century and there be no possible way that one can live without the other .
even partition be not a possibility , there be no clear border between the two .
remember Luis Posada Carriles ?
here be a Miami Herald interview with the relaxed terrorist and former CIA operative in a luxury condo , publish yesterday .
( " at first I hide a lot .
I think the US government be look for I .
now I hide a lot less . " )
because of such talk , Posada have be take into custody by immigration official .
I can not imagine they want to do this .
authority would likely have be happy answer question about Posada 's whereabouts with a indefinite shrug .
he should have take a cue from another bomber some pesky dark - skinned foreigner want extradite , CIA operative Michael Meiring .
Posada should have tell any inquisitive journalist at he doorstep something like Meiring tell the single american reporter who bother follow he bloody trail from the Philippines , that " if this harm I in any way , you will find my power then , and you will find out who I be . "
but then , maybe that would not have save he either , because Posada be not Meiring .
Posada can be give up , but Meiring can not .
Meiring 's crime be fresh , and wave the false flag which be the " war on terror . "
they happen in the Philippines which , like Pakistan , be a important and vulnerable node for the business which intelligence agency and terrorist organization conduct with each other .
( ask Terry Nichols about the Philippines . )
Posada 's crime , on the other hand , must seem like ancient history , especially to a people who do not know they history .
and to those who do not even know they crime , not even that .
but will Posada be give up ?
I doubt he will be extradite to Venezuela , which be the only way that question could be answer with a yes .
I expect it will be determine that , under " strong man " Hugo Chavez , Posada could not be guarantee a fair trial .
the hope may be that Posada can soon be offer to a post-chavez Allawi - like puppet in Caracas .
whether such a offer be accept or decline would make no difference ; justice would not be serve then .
so instead Posada may be hold indefinitely , in comfortable custody .
Meiring be more than a embarrassment .
he case threaten the consensus fiction of the " war on terror . "
so he name will remain unspoken .
another connection to philippine terror and weapon smuggle - date from the 1980 - be allege in the book Disposable Patriot , by Jack Terrell .
Terrell , a CIA asset originally recruit for the Contra effort , identify the man attempt to recruit he into the philippine scheme as Oliver North ...
I seem to recall the object be to smuggle explosive .
I have read the book - it be a first person memoir with the ring of truth , especially since so much of the wider context have confirm the allegation of Contra drug connection that lead to Terrell become a target for discrediting by the TWIG counterintelligence group that run interference for the Contra effort , staff by covert op type include Ollie North , Robert Owen , Vince Cannistaro and Buck Revell .
Peter Dale Scott include a account of how Terrell 's whistleblowing be stifle by they in he book Cocaine Politics .
... same ole , same ole ...
due to the judge in the 1983 case rule that a CIA agent could not testify use a pseudonym , therefore open he to cross-examination by Wilson , the prosecution have a problem .
they need someone that could convince the jury they have be able to see all relevant document in CIA file on Wilson .
Wilson be claim that he have be work for the CIA when he sell the c - 4 to Quaddaffi .
the prosecution be charge he be a rogue use he contact from former service in both CIA and the ' Office of Naval Intelligence ' .
Wilson have be able to show that he would have more than 80 " non-social contact " with the CIA since he retirement in 1971 , leave the prosecution 's case in turmoil .
then Charles A. Briggs come to the rescue .
the Briggs Declaration state that with one exception in 1972 , Wilson do not work " directly or indirectly " for the CIA since retire .
last week , Federal District Judge Lynn Hughes in Huston , Texas , throw out Wilson 's two - decade old conviction .
Judge Hughes write : ` government knowingly use false evidence against he , ' conclude ` honesty come hard to government . '
look like it be rear its head again in Louisianna ..

PONCHATOULA , La. --
sheriff 's deputy in Louisiana make a third arrest Wednesday in the ongoing investigation of a case involve allegation of sexual abuse of child and animal at a Ponchatoula , La. , church .

+ as the implication of the Andaman Islands situation sink in , indian intelligence have inevitably come under scrutiny .

trouble on India 's island
in early February , India charge 34 arakan separatist from Myanmar with hide in the Landfall Islands , part of the Andaman Islands group ( see end note ) .
these alleged member of the Arakan Army , the military wing of the National Unity Party in Myanmar , have be charge with illegal entry .
it be likely , but not certain , that they will be deport to Myanmar .
but the news of the arakan rebel be just the tip of the iceberg when it come to grow concern in New Delhi over the security of the Andaman Islands .
report be circulate in the intelligence community that the Andaman Islands be not only thick with Myanmar rebel .
information point in this direction come to light after the December 26 tsunami , which take a heavy toll on the Andamans .
correspondent who flock in to cover the tsunami find they also have another story - the miserable security situation surround the indian navy 's Far Eastern Naval Command , now be establish along with India 's " blue water navy " .
security problem in the Andaman Sea be not new , but they have deteriorate during the past few year , in tandem with a deterioration in the security situation in Bangladesh , Nepal and Bhutan , and particularly in the northeastern indian state of Manipur , Nagaland and Tripura .
while the indian army have become rock - solid in the western front , and have develop the capability of withstand any pakistani adventure in that sector , it have become highly vulnerable in its eastern sector , where its enemy be not a national army but a multitude of secessionist , terrorist and drug - run militant operate between Southeast Asia and northeastern India through Bangladesh .
the Andaman Sea be a major conduit for this traffic , and the 572 large and small island that constitute the Andaman and Nicobar group be a natural transit base .
the drug and arm travel in all direction .
since the " Sea Tigers " of the LTTE , better know as the Tamil Tigers , be the one who rule the Andaman Sea : they carry the arm and drug for they own use and also to deliver to rebel in Aceh and all along the east coast of Africa .
it be old news that the Tamil Tigers have develop a strong network within South Africa .
this be not unknown to New Delhi .
a recent report by a journalist from Port Blair , in the Andamans , quote a unnamed official say that foreigner from Myanmar , Bangladesh and Sri Lanka have permanently settle in the island , use fake indian ration card , while citizen of Thailand , China , Indonesia and Malaysia have migrate temporarily to plunder the natural resource and leave .
" Port Blair , Havelock Islands , Diglipur , Middle Nicobar , Campbell 's Bay , Neil Islands and Rangott be mostly overrun by foreigner , " he say .
a official estimate issue in 2003 suggest there be 50,000 " foreigner " in the Andaman Islands , but unofficial figure be much higher than this .
a large number of they be Bangladeshis , who like million of they countryman have leave they densely populate homeland to settle elsewhere .
as most of they have few technical skill , and the Andamans have little demand for they in any case , they turn to smuggling and other unlawful activity .
the presence of the Sea Tigers in the area with gun , cash and drug make the situation extremely dangerous .
report from Port Blair make it evident that New Delhi get little on - the - ground intelligence , and the indian Coast Guard be grossly unequipped to deal with the surge of illegal migrant to the island .
one unnamed naval officer be quote say , " arm smuggling be a very profitable business in this region . "
consider the island 's huge strategic importance , it be amazing how lax New Delhi have be .
these island sit aside the vital sea lane of the Strait of Malacca , through which 300 tanker and merchant ship pass daily , bring in oil for the Far East and Southeast Asia .
as the implication of the Andaman Islands situation sink in , indian intelligence have inevitably come under scrutiny .
the inability to foresee in advance the assassination attempt on the pro-india political leader and former bangladeshi prime minister Sheikh Hasina Wazed last August 21 at a political rally in Dhaka , and the recent " coup " by nepalese King Gyanendra dismiss he government and impose a virtual absolute monarchy , be glaring example of intelligence failure .
with grow economic and military power , India will be dependent on smaller nation in the region increasingly to maintain regional security .
unless New Delhi do better in provide security to its own national against rebel , secessionist , drug runner and arm trafficker , it will not generate much confidence in the capital of surround nation .
in fact , it would tend to encourage more organized anti-india outfit , such as the pakistani inter- Services Intelligence ( ISI ) and outside - link Maoists , to exploit these network and weaken India 's eastern flank .
indian intelligence 's lackluster performance in deal with the LTTE be startling .
this formidable enemy , which give the indian army a black eye in the mid-1980 , have be operate in northeastern India and in the Andaman Sea for a long time .
in 2001 , accord to indian army official , security force launch a wide - range operation in the 300 - some inhabit island neighbor Andaman and Nicobar , and find huge cache of arm .
the arm be say to belong to the LTTE and " other terrorist group " .
in addition , LTTE activity in the Andaman Sea be well known to local observer .
the biggest LTTE maritime disaster be report in the now - defunct Asiaweek in 2001 .
a shipment of weapon , ammunition and explosive , believe to have be purchase from Cambodia and worth several million dollar , leave the port of Phuket in Thailand in early February 2001 aboard the freighter Comex - Joux 3 .
as be LTTE standard procedure , the vessel change its name at sea to Horizon .
on its journey across the Bay of Bengal the freighter be track by the indian navy and Orissa - base spy plane of India 's Aviation Research Center ; it be intercept by indian naval vessel off Sri Lanka 's east coast .
LTTE arm - running
in 1997 , the thai navy report the interception of a 16 - meter boat after a chase off the thai port of Ranong , and the confiscation of two ton of weapon and ammunition .
among the weapon intercept be two rocket - propel - grenade launcher , 20 assault rifle , m - 79 grenade launcher and more than 10,000 round of ammunition .
four person be arrest , reportedly belong to the Manipur Revolutionary People 's Front .
six crew member be from the Arakan region of Myanmar .
the boat be head toward Cox 's Bazar in Bangladesh .
until 1995 the LTTE maintain a base at Twante , a island off the coat of Myanmar , west of the Andaman island .
subsequently , Phuket become the LTTE 's main backup base .
a Sri Lanka - bear Tamil with a norwegian passport be arrest by thai authority in 2000 for he link with the LTTE .
at the time of he arrest , the suspect be allegedly involved in construct a " submarine " in a shipyard on the island of Sirae near Phuket on the Andaman Sea coast .
the real threat to the Andaman island be the steady building - up of port and conduit that serve the Tamil Tigers and a host of less - strong militant group .
over the past decade , Bangladesh have steadily move into a state of lawlessness .
it be widely acknowledge that the pakistani ISI have nurture a number of extremist Islamist group , such as the Harkat - ul - Jehad - al - Islami , in the port city of Chittagong , and put a number of secessionist rebel from India 's northeast in touch with this terrorist network .
a pattern of arrest and seizure indicate that arm be bring by the LTTE from Laos , Cambodia and Thailand into Chittagong , from where they be transport northward by land to Bhutan .
the route from Kalikhola in Bhutan to Cox 's Bazar pass through northern Bengal , Assam and Meghalaya , and on into Chittagong .
India 's Andaman and Nicobar Islands comprise more than 500 island lie 1,000 kilometer east of Sri Lanka in the Bay of Bengal .
stretch 750 kilometer from end to end , they reach from near the coast of Myanmar almost to Sumatra in Indonesia .
the Ten Degree Channel divide the Andamans , which be the larger and more heavily populate northern island , from the 20 or so Nicobar Islands in the south .
on South Andaman , the most heavily populate island , be Port Blair , which be the capital and the only large town in the entire archipelago .
travel to the Nicobar Islands be forbidden to non-Indians , and they be also not allow in some part of South Andaman Island .

[ Karzai also have to deal with the step up rivalry between India and Pakistan in Afghanistan .
Islamabad accuse New Delhi of use its consulate in Kandahar and Jalalabad to train balochi insurgent who be active in pakistani Balochistan .
" there have no business be there unless they be undermine Pakistan , '' say a pakistani official .
both India and Afghanistan deny the claim .
'' should Pakistan show we any evidence of a indian hand use afghan soil to work against we neighbour we will take it very seriously , " say Amrullah Saleh the head of Afghanistan 's National Security Directorate . ]
Karzai , Musharraf new regional equation
the neighbour be still interfere , but there be sign that rather than undermine Afghanistan 's stability they may now be try to strengthen it .
" the election should be a reassurance to all we neighbour that a stable Afghanistan , a peaceful Afghanistan be good for all .
nobody should feel a looser in Afghanistan , '' President Hamid Karzai tell Pakistan 's English daily the Nation .
all the regional country have publicly back the Karzai government and support the electoral process , but serious undercurrent remain as they all have they favourite contender in Afghanistan .
since September 11 , Pakistan have be repeatedly accuse by afghan and western leader of harbour Taliban extremist who have pledge to disrupt the election , but at the highest level the US have avoid criticise President Pervaiz Musharraf on the grounds that he be help the US catch Al Qaeda element inside Pakistan .
that change on September 22 when President George W. Bush , Musharraf and Karzai hold a three way meeting in New York on the sideline of the UN General Assembly .
the meeting be push together by the CIA and the US Defence Department who be desperately anxious to secure a peaceful election in Afghanistan and the non-interference of alleged Pakistani back Taliban .
'' where be Mullah Omar , Mullah Usmani and Gulbuddin Hikmetar ? ''
Bush be report to have ask a flustered Musharraf .
all three be extremist Taliban or they ally and know to be live in Pakistan .
( Mullah Omar be leader of the Taliban , Usmani be the former corps commander of Kandahar under the Taliban regime and now a commander of Taliban force while Hikmetyar head the extremist Hizb - e - Islami . )
'' it be the first time that Bush totally focus on the Taliban threat rather than Al Qaeda with the Pakistanis , '' say a western diplomat .
'' Bush be very well brief before the meeting , '' the diplomat say .
a afghan official at the meeting add , '' the Americans now realise that the Taliban be a bigger threat to we security than Al Qaeda . ''
Karzai be clearly pleased at the result .
'' President Musharraf promise to help we and cooperate with we on curb terrorist activity by the Taliban , '' say Karzai .
the next day a angry Musharraf categorically say that Pakistan would not send pakistani troops to Iraq , a clear snub to the Americans .
until then he have say Pakistan 's option be open .
however pakistani official insist that the decision be unconnected to the tripartite meeting .
US and NATO military officer in Kabul say it be too early to say whether Bush 's tough message be instrumental in persuade Musharraf and the ISI to pressure the Taliban to restrain from disrupt the election .
however there be visible sign of a crackdown on the Pakistan side .
'' Pakistan now have a large force deploy in Baluchistan which be not there before , '' say Lt. General David Barno .
'' there be much better tactical cooperation between we force on both side of the border , but the movement of Taliban still go on both way , '' he add .
also several day before the election Pakistan close the border crossing point at Chaman in Baluchistan which be a key entry point for the Taliban into Afghanistan .
however US military officer say regular army officer - many of they pashtun - lead unit of the Frontier Corps who be on the border remain deeply sympathetic to the Taliban and the mulla of the JUI .
not only be the army face serious political fallout , grow anti-americanism and anti-army feeling in the tribal area but it be also take heavy casualty - between 400 - 500 pakistani soldier have be kill in the region since March .
Musharraf have always maintain that the US have never provide actionable intelligence about Taliban leader hide in Baluchistan .
that too may change .
US and afghan intelligence will shortly be present the ISI with a list of Taliban extremist and they suspect whereabouts .
moreover there be now major covert attempt under way to try and bring back to Kabul lead Taliban commander , who have be live quietly in Pakistan and have take no part in the Taliban insurgency .
with the Taliban failure to disrupt the afghan election , the militant be even more isolated from the mainstream Taliban who want to return home .
until now Pakistan have not facilitate such a return and clearly it can not happen until there be both a pull from Kabul and a push from Islamabad .
with President Karzai certain to win the election and the demotion of key former Northern Alliance figure such as General Fahim and warlord Ismail Khan , there be now little reason for moderate Taliban leader to fear reprisal from former Northern Alliance figure if they return home .
they removal should also provide increase motivation for Pakistan to help the return of moderate Taliban .
afghan official welcome the appointment on October 3 of Lt. General Ashfaq Kiyani as the new ISI chief .
Kayani be well know and like in Kabul as during the last year he lead the pakistani delegation in the tripartite military meeting with the afghan and US military on issue related to border issue .
Karzai also have to deal with the step up rivalry between India and Pakistan in Afghanistan .
Islamabad accuse New Delhi of use its consulate in Kandahar and Jalalabad to train balochi insurgent who be active in pakistani Balochistan .
" there have no business be there unless they be undermine Pakistan , '' say a pakistani official .
both India and Afghanistan deny the claim .
'' should Pakistan show we any evidence of a indian hand use afghan soil to work against we neighbour we will take it very seriously , " say Amrullah Saleh the head of Afghanistan 's National Security Directorate .
Karzai categorically say that he have assure Musharraf repeatedly that any adverse action against Pakistan take by indian diplomat inside Afghanistan would be act upon swiftly .
senior US diplomat and military official have warn India also .
in a major regional shift reflect the newly strengthen position of Karzai , Iran , Russia and India which have traditionally back the Tajik dominate former Northern Alliance make strenuous effort to convince presidential candidate Younis Qanooni to strike a deal with Karzai before the election and not to oppose Karzai .
Iran in particular fear that Qanooni would loose and then be politically isolate from the mainstream .
Qanooni refuse to accept the iranian advice as he fellow panjsheri Tajiks urge he to stand against Karzai .
however since the election iranian influence have prove critical in convince the Hazara Shia candidate Mohammed Mohaqeq to accept the result of the election and later convince Qanooni to do the same .
with the US military presence pose a threat on they border in both Iraq and Afghanistan , Iran 's moderate leadership be keen to help stabilise Karzai so that the US presence in Afghanistan be reduce .
however powerful hardliner in Tehran may be try to undermine that strategy and a new issue be likely to deepen the rift with the moderate .
iranian official be deeply concerned about the US occupation of Shindand , a massive Soviet - era airbase just 30 kilometre from Iran 's border .
the enhance US presence in western Afghanistan be only make possible after the ousting of Ismail Khan , the warlord and Governor of Herat province last month , who be a close ally of iranian hardliner .
iranian official say they make no objection to Khan 's ouster because they want to strengthen Karzai 's campaign against warlord .
afghan official say the Americans have move over 100 special force and helicopter to Shindand .
however General Barno insist the US presence pose no threat to Iran .
'' we have a very small number of force in Shindand with a few helicopter , '' say Barno .
nevertheless this place Karzai in a difficult and sensitive situation because he have to maintain excellent relation with both the US and Iran .
'' Afghanistan have have the benefit of cooperation from both the US and Iran .
so far what they have do together have be good for we and that be how we would like to keep it '' , say Karzai .
nobody can claim that the interference of Afghanistan 's neighbour be over , but the election will do much to strengthen Karzai and deal more firmly with neighbour 's interference .
in the post election scenario it be become abundantly clear that the Taliban do not have the support of the afghan people nor the afghan Pashtuns .
in a highly significant move afghan pashtun tribe along the Pakistan border warn the Taliban in Quetta and Chaman that if they try and disrupt the election , they would be resist .
many Taliban live in Afghanistan vote for President Karzai .
it be now abundantly clear that with the rapidly change face of Afghanistan , the demise of key Northern Alliance figure and the fluid political situation in Afghanistan , Pakistan should reconsider its policy of give unlimited sanctuary to Taliban extremist live on pakistani soil .
Pakistan Link 16/10/2004
the debate that a handful of Texas multi-millionnaire close to the Bush family have cleverly manufacture over John Kerry 's war record be absurd in every way .
most of those make the charge have even flip - flop , contradict themselves .
but to address the substance of this big lie be to risk fall into its logic .
the true absurdity of the entire situation be easily appreciate when we consider that George W. Bush never show any bravery at all at any point in he life .
he have never live in a war zone .
if some of John Kerry 's wound be superficial , Bush receive no wound .
( and , a piece of shrapnel in the forearm that cause only a minor wound would have kill have it hit a eye and go into the brain ; the shrapnel be in you body demonstrate you be in mortal danger and do not absent yourself from it .
that be the logic of the medal ) .
Kerry save a man 's life while under fire .
Bush do no such thing .
what be Bush do with he youth ?
he be drink .
he be drink like a fish , every night , into the wee hour .
for decade .
he give no service to anyone , risk nothing , and do not even slack off efficiently .
the history of alcoholism and possibly other drug use be a key issue because it not only speak to Bush 's character as a addictive personality , but may tell we something about he erratic and alarming action as president .
he explosive temper probably provoke the disastrous siege of Fallujah last spring , kill 600 Iraqis , most of they woman and child , in revenge for the death of 4 civilian mercenary , one of they a South African .
( Newsweek report that Bush command he cabinet , " let head roll ! " )
that temper be only one problem .
Bush have a sadistic streak .
he clearly enjoy , as governor , watch execution .
he have clearly go on enjoy kill people on a large scale in Iraq .
drug abuse can affect the ability of the person to feel deep emotion like empathy .
two decade of pickle he nervous system in various highly toxic substance have leave Bush damage goods .
even for those who later abstain , " visual - spatial ability , abstraction , problem solving , and short - term memory , be the slowest to recover . "
that he manage to get on the wagon ( though with that pretzel incident , you wonder how firmly ) be laudable .
we all know by now that Bush do not even do he full service with the Texas Air National Guard , absent himself to work on the Alabama senate campaign of Winton " Red " Blount .
whether he be actually awol during this stint be unclear .
but it be clear that not only do Bush slack off on he National Guard service , but he slack off from he campaign work .
this little - note interview with Blount 's nephew Murph Archibald , which appear on National Public Radio 's " all Things consider on March 30 , 2004 , give a devastating insight into what it be like to have to suffer through Bush in that period .
this campaign season , there have be question about whether George W. Bush fulfil he obligation to the National Guard as a young lieutenant in the early 1970 .
for week , reporter scour Alabama in search of pilot or anyone who might have remember see Mr. Bush at the time he be serve in the National Guard there .
there be one place in Alabama where Mr. Bush be present nearly every day : the headquarters in Montgomery of US Senate candidate Winton " Red " Blount .
President Bush have always say that work for Blount be the reason he transfer to the Alabama Air National Guard .
NPR 's Wade Goodwyn have this report about Mr. Bush 's time on that campaign .
WADE GOODWYN report :
in 1972 , Baba Groom be a smart , funny young woman smack - dab in the middle of a exciting US Senate campaign .
Groom be Republican Red Blount 's scheduler , and in that job , she be the hub in the campaign wheel .
ask she about the handsome young man from Texas , and she remember he 32 year later like it be yesterday .
Ms. BABA GROOM ( former campaign worker ) :
he would wear khaki trousers and some old jacket .
he be always ready to go out on the road .
on the phone , you could hear he accent .
it be a Texas accent .
but he just meld with everybody .
GOODWYN : the candidate Mr. Bush be work for , Red Blount , have get rich in Alabama in the construction business .
prominent southern Republicans be something of a rare breed in those day .
Blount 's support of the party lead he to be appoint Richard Nixon 's postmaster general .
that be how 26 - year - old Lieutenant Bush come to Montgomery , at he father 's urging . . .
it be Mr. Bush 's job to organize the republican county chairperson in the 67 Alabama county .
back in 1972 in the deep south , many rural county do not have much in the way of official Republican Party apparatus .
but throughout Alabama , there be Republicans and Democrats who want to help Red Blount .
it be the young Texan 's job to find out what each county leader need in the way of campaign supplies and get those supplies to they .
Groom say this job help Mr. Bush understand how even in a statewide Senate campaign , politics be local .
. . . Murph Archibald be Red Blount 's nephew by marriage , and in 1972 , he be come off a 15 - month tour in Vietnam in the infantry .
Archibald say that in a campaign full of dedicated worker , Mr. Bush be not one of they .
Mr. MURPH ARCHIBALD ( nephew of Red Blount ) : well , I be come in early in the morning and leave in mid-evening .
ordinarily , George would come in around noon ; he would ordinarily leave around 5:30 or 6:00 in the evening .
Mr. ARCHIBALD : George certainly do not seem to have any concern about my take over this work with the campaign worker there .
my overall impression be that he do not seem as interested in the campaign as the other people who be work at the state headquarters .
GOODWYN : Murph Archibald say that at first , he do not know that Mr. Bush be serve in the Air National Guard .
after he find out from somebody else , Archibald attempt to talk to Mr. Bush about it .
the president be a lieutenant and Archibald have be a lieutenant , too ; he figure they have something to talk about .
Mr. ARCHIBALD : George do not have any interest at all in talk about the military .
in fact , when I broach the subject with he , he simply change the subject .
he be not unpleasant about it , but he just change the subject and would not talk about it .
GOODWYN : far from Texas and Washington , DC , Mr. Bush enjoy he freedom .
he date a beautiful young woman work on the campaign .
he go out in the evening and have a good time .
in fact , he leave the house he rent in such disrepair -- with damage to the wall and a chandelier destroy -- that the Montgomery family who own it still grumble about the unpaid repair bill .
Archibald say Mr. Bush would come into the office and , in a friendly way , offer up story about the drinking he would do the night before , kind of as a conversation starter .
Mr. ARCHIBALD : people have different way of start the day in any office .
they be go to talk about they kid , they be go to talk about football , they be go to talk about the weather .
GOODWYN : Archibald say the frequency with which Mr. Bush discuss the subject be off - putting to he .
Mr. ARCHIBALD : I mean , at that time , I be 28 ; George would have be 25 or 26 .
and I think it be really unusual that someone in they mid-20 would initiate conversation , particularly in the context of something as serious as a US senatorial campaign , by talk about they drinking the night before .
I think it unusual and , frankly , inappropriate .
Archibald , a middle - class Alabama boy -- who , by the way , be now a register Democrat -- do not like that story .
Mr. ARCHIBALD : he tell we whenever he be stop , as soon as the law enforcement find out that he be the grandson of Prescott Bush , they would let he go .
and he would always laugh about that . "
Goodwyn dutifully note that Baba Groom do not remember George tell drunk story .
but that mean nothing , since they be not the sort of thing guy like Bush tell the " girl " .
he be try to buddy with Archibald and impress he .
again , decade of this sort of behavior do not leave a person untouched .
we world be in crisis and we republic be in danger .
it should not be leave in the hand of a man who spend he life like this .
when the city be on fire with the burn flesh of man
just remember that death be not the end
and you search in vain to find just one law abide citizen
just remember that death be not the end - Bob Dylan
afraid I do not have time today to discuss these , but some story need attention :
from Wednesday 's Mirror the headline , " have 200,000 ak47 fall into the hand of Iraq terrorist ? "
( also see this thread on the RI discussion board ) :
some 200,000 gun the US send to iraqi security force may have be smuggle to terrorist , it be fear yesterday .
the 99 - tonne cache of ak47 be to have be secretly fly out from a US base in Bosnia .
but the four planeload of arm have vanish .
order for the deal to go ahead be give by the US Department of Defense .
but the work be contract out via a complex web of private arm trader .
and the moldovan airline use to transport the shipment be blast by the UN in 2003 for smuggle arm to Liberia , human rights group Amnesty have discover .
it follow a separate probe claim that thousand of gun mean for Iraq 's police and army instead go to al - Qaeda .
Amnesty chief spokesman Mike Blakemore say : " it be unbelievable that no one can account for 200,000 assault rifle .
if these weapon have go missing it be a terrifying prospect . "
american defence chief hire a US firm to take the gun , from the 90 bosnian war , to Iraq .
but air traffic controller in Baghdad have no record of the flight , which supposedly take off between July 2004 and July 2005 .
a coalition force spokesman confirm they have not receive " any weapon from Bosnia " and add they be " not aware of any purchase for Iraq from Bosnia " .
Nato and US official have already voice fear that bosnian arm - sell by US , british and swiss firm - be be pass to insurgent .
a NATO spokesman say : " there be no tracking mechanism to ensure they do not fall into the wrong hand .
there be concern that some may have be siphon off . "
this year a newspaper claim two UK firm be involved in a deal in which thousand of gun for iraqi force be re-route to al - Qaeda .
the moldovan airline be Aerocom , and yes , it be one of Victor Bout 's .
it be always a bang - you - head - against - the - wall moment , read again the play the incompetence theory receive , even from some of the administration 's harshest mainstream critic .
but then , even to talk of a " administration " may be misdirection at this point , give how little representative government mean in the United States these day , and how much of " national security " have be privatize into a global gangland of drug and gun .
but Bout 's name be not likely to be mention in whatever coverage this story receive , before it sink like so many other beneath the media 's froth triviality .
meanwhile , a decision be be reach in the trial of Toledo priest Gerald Robinson .
and it be guilty :
the Rev. Gerald Robinson appear stony - faced as the jury 's guilty verdict be read , and he blink repeatedly and glance at he lawyer before be lead away in handcuffs .
the crime occur in the sacristy adjoin the hospital chapel in downtown toledo on the Saturday before Easter in 1980 .
investigator say the nun , Margaret Ann Pahl , 71 , be strangle and then stab , with nine wound on she chest form the shape of a invert cross , a well - recognize satanic symbol .
a altar cloth be drape over she half - naked body , which be pose as if she have be sexually assault .
" it be about how he could humiliate she the most , " prosecutor Dean Mandros say in close argument .
" he leave a message for everyone to see ... maybe to God himself . "
after the sentencing one of Robinson 's tearful supporter " turn to Claudia Vercellotti , a local leader of the Survivors Network for those abuse by Priests [ SNAP ] , who have help reopen the case , and tell she , ' I hope you rot in hell ! ' "
from SNAP 's statement on the Robinson conviction :
more than ever , police and prosecutor have the tool and the will to go after horrific crime , even when the defendant be seemingly powerful individual or institution .
when victim and witness stay silent , nothing change .
when victim and witness speak up , at least sometimes a child be protect , the truth be expose , and justice be do .
the murder weapon , Robinson 's letter opener :
finally , from a email , a follow - up on the reopening of the investigation into the Atlanta child murder :
Dekalb County Police Chief Louis Graham ... the man who reopen the investigation last year , be mysteriously step down .
and of all the people who the county be get to find a replacement ... be none other than Lee Brown , the original supervisor of the Atlanta PD , who be in office during the murder and the subsequent investigation .
SNAP be right in part .
police and prosecutor have the tool .
the will be another matter .
some do , individually .
but institutionally ?
that be still the domain of those who do not .
lot of important story out there today jeff .... thank god and a few good soul for that conviction .
have you send this to congress yet ?
talk about law enforcement not have the will ...
crackdown on polygamy group
small polygamous group have exist in the southwestern US under the watchful yet fairly benign eye of authority ever since a sect know as the Fundamentalist Latter Day Saints ( FLDS ) separate itself from mainstream Mormonism in 1890 .
when the FLDS under Mr. Jeffs ( and he father before he ) grow to some 10,000 follower in several southwestern community with estimate asset of $ 110 million ; when it become clear that government official , school authority , and police in those community have become intertwined with the sect ; when ex-member increasingly report child and sexual abuse charge ( mainly involve underage girl force to marry older man ) ; and when the sect begin to use secluded compound , state and federal authority start to crack down more vigorously .
specifically , Jeffs be charge in Utah and Arizona with sexual assault of underage girl and with arrange " spiritual " marriage for girl and older man .
at weekend press conference in Salt Lake City and Phoenix , FBI and state official say Jeffs " be consider armed and dangerous and may be travel with armed bodyguard . "
in the past , he have talk in apocalyptic term about a violent end to the world , accord to former member .
as with Christian Identity and other hate - related philosophy tie to the Aryan Nations and the neo-nazi Creativity Movement , Jeffs have preach racism as well .
" the black race be the people through which the devil have always be able to bring evil unto the earth , " Jeffs have say as cite by the Southern Poverty Law Center 's " intelligence report . "
a editorial in the church - own Deseret Morning News in Salt Lake City earlier this year acknowledge that " the state 's history , a conservative belief in free choice , and a unwillingness to stir up a hornet 's nest in the national media have likely all contribute to the kid - glove approach lawmaker and law - enforcement officer have take when deal with polygamous community . "
maybe I be miss something here , but how , exactly , do one ' loose ' 200,000 ak47' ?
" there be no tracking mechanism in place " ?!?!?
never mind .
no need to worry .
I be sure this kind of thing go on all the time .
we now return you to you regularly schedule programming ....
just go here , it be simply amazing
the Raw Story
i count like 14 explosive headline .
then , of course , there be the evidence the jury do not hear about in the Robinson case ...
funny how some thing be squirell away by well - mean prosecutor ...
I read of a case not long ago when some people be try to get a polygamous judge take off the bench for not obey state law .
of course law enforcement have drag it's feet when member be take part in the activity themselves .
personally I do not give a damn what adult do to one another as long as there be no abuse invovle .
it be the marrying off of young girl to older man often close relative that enfurate I .
also these cult have multimillion yet the woman and kid live in poverty so the leader can live the high life .
in the Warren Jeffs cult he reassign wife if the husband displease he or to reward the new husband .
husband marry mother and teen daughter at the same time .
a rare form of retardation be show up in that group more than anywhere else in the world .
it be genetic and the child need to get the gene from both parent to turn into a vegetable instead of a think child .
the doctor beg they to stop intermarry but they say they have to keep the blood pure .
look up fumarase deficiency for more info .
also look up the kingston family .
one member actually be convict of beat he teen daughter unconcious when she run away from ' marriage ' to she father 's own brother .
no one be charge for force marriage , only the beating .
so we " lose " some weapon ?
it be a good thing too .
we would not want those terrorist to run out of shit to shoot at we .
then the war might stop & all those juicy profit would just evaporate .
what be a few dead soldier in comparison to keep all those defense contractor awash in all that tax cash ?
they really be milk the incompetence angle though , be not they ?
just another big Iraq whoopsie daisy , huh ?
christ , you would think America would get a bit tired of these guy treat she like she be populate with nothing but gullible idiot .
I suppose that it be damn lucky for the GOP that she be populate with gullible idiot .
US outsource special op , intelligence to Iraq terror group , intelligence official say
the Pentagon be bypass official US intelligence channel and turn to a dangerous and unruly cast of character in order to create strife in Iran in preparation for any possible attack , former and current intelligence official say ...
a country deserve the leader it have , my friend ...
as the leader like to boast , the Mujahedeen be a family affair .
( '' we have three generation of martyr : grandmother , mother , daughter . '' )
most of the girl I be meet have grow up in Mujahedeen school in Ashraf , where they live separate from they parent .
family visit be allow on Thursday night and Fridays .
when Iraq invade Kuwait , many of these girl be transport to Jordan and then smuggle to various country -- Germany , France , Canada , Denmark , England , the United States -- where they be raise by guardian who be usually Mujahedeen supporter .
when they be 18 or 19 , many of they decide to come back to Iraq and fill the rank of the youngest Mujahedeen generation .
though '' decided '' be probably not the right word , since from the day they be bear , these girl and boy be not teach to think for themselves but to blindly follow they leader .
'' every morning and night , the kid , begin as young as 1 and 2 , have to stand before a poster of Massoud and Maryam , salute they and shout praise to they , '' Nadereh Afshari , a former Mujahedeen deep - believer , tell I .
Afshari , who be post in Germany and be responsible for receive Mujahedeen child during the gulf war , say that when the german government try to absorb Mujahedeen child into they education system , the Mujahedeen refuse .
many of the child be send to Mujahedeen school , particularly in France .
the Rajavis , Afshari go on to say , '' see these kid as the next generation 's soldier .
they want to brainwash they and control they . ''
which may explain the pattern to they story : a journey to self - empowerment and the enlightenment of self - sacrifice inspire by the light and wisdom of Maryam and Massoud .
one have to wonder whether the bright fellow in we government and military who set up the deal with these people do not know what they be , do not care , or know perfectly well .
SPLOID.com cite you on the topic of that priest conviction : http://www.sploid.com/news/2006/05/evil_priest_gui.php
Jimmy Plant , Blogshares be a fantasy blogosphere trading game with pretend money .
that be all I know ; I have have nothing to do with it .
Bush successfully make Satan look good in comparison .
or something like that .
okay , it be partly about stripper and dope .
and we will get around to that .
but more and more , as metal evolve into a huge international music that belong to everyone , it have get to be something weirder .
praise be : give the void in responsible behavior among government , police , educational establishment and religion , the task of guide we youth down the path of righteousness have fall to ... Satan "
the people who carry out these underground arm / drug / sex trafficking deal be trauma base mind control slave .
the moldovan airline be Aerocom , and yes , it be one of Victor Bout 's .
the wikipedia entry for Aerocom be just a stub .. wait for someone to put some information into it ....
so ... put some information in there .
you know , nature hate a void . :)
i agree , hmmmmmm .
what about Manson 's tee bear the message , " kill you parent " .
and be the Columbine killer act out this " real morality " when they indescriminately murder they classmate .
they be death metal brainwash fan , literally fulfil the death metal paradigm , er ... morality .
so , hmmmm indeed .
I detect the hiss lisp of the lie serpent in this article .
the deathly inversion of truth , ala satanism .
I think the jury be still out on exactly who do the brainwashing when in regard to the Columbine killer .
perhaps we should look at the death metal phenomenon less as a invitation to violence than as a couter-cultural response to the over hypocrisy of a large percentage of the ' church - morality ' crowd , which give a lot of lip service to love thy neighbor , but do not apply that love very far beyond they own congregation .
the last I check , the Satanists have a long way to go to catch up with the death and destruction deal out by self - proclaim ( though false ) Christians .
irony be dead ... long live irony !
that be it .
I be fire my editor .
well , it be not as simple and clear cut as all that .
we be enter into some interesting and perhaps previously unexplored socio-political - spiritual territory here that may require further examination and serious introspection .
the Kevin Coogan publication post on the previous thread might serve as a good launching point for further discussion .
the follow quote be from that Coogan article :
imaginary evil be romantic and varied ; real evil be gloomy , monotonous , barren , boring .
imaginary good be boring ; real good be always new , marvelous , intoxicating .
- Simone Weil
I would not wonder too hard .
the answer be likely d : all of the above , due to this be a complex reality we live in .
but to I , without question , they often know perfectly well .
here be a thought : when the appartently cognitively functional take action that seem senseless and incompetent , it be a most certain sign that they have ulterior or hidden motive .
they trust you and I to be befuddle by they action , while they " do as they will " .
to not buy the bs
& here I be think that I really must be get old .
since the article be specifically about " death metal " I guess the author miss this little tidbit or we just have waaaaaaaaaaaaay different definition of morality :
one man 's relentless search for he missing son lead he to uncover one of the most shocking crime in post-war Italy - a tale of satanism and violence that have grip the country for more than a year .
in January 1998 Fabio Tollis and Chiara Marino , both just 16 , disappear .
they have be drink at a pub call the Midnight - the centre of the heavy metal scene in Milan - and they never come home .
the police and many of they friend just think they have run off together .
but they parent refuse to accept this .
Michele Tollis , Fabio 's father , begin to attend metal concert and festival across Europe , hand out leaflet and quiz Fabio 's friend .
Fabio and he friend be into the most extreme form of heavy metal music - death metal and black metal , music obsessed with image of murder and satanism - and the role of this music be central to the story .
no one can contradict I when I say that heavy metal and satanism be closely link
it emerge that Chiara , the girl who disappear with Fabio , have a collection of satanic literature and paraphernalia in she bedroom .
" no one can contradict I when I say that heavy metal and satanism be closely link .
they be inseparable , " he say .
yeah , I think Jeff write on one of he post here in the past several month : " to hell with death " .
I wholly agree , and would expand that statement to include : " to hell with death metal " .
the freaky thing here be that these bozo be seriously claim the moral high ground ? ? ? ? ?
talk about a beat - you - head - against - the - wall moment !
and for ' Smartwolf ' above , think about the inversion principle be employ .
they be do it deliberately .
do you really think GWB , and neocon in general be representative of true follower of Jesus of Nazareth ?
they be merely imposter .
so why even credit they claim ?
this only serve they purpose .
they want to be identify as ' Christians ' , and I fully suspect that for some of they , the motivation behind they subterfuge be more than mere political advantage , and have a lot more to do with the black magician 's practice of the inversion principle .
we need to be more ' rigorous ' about how we perceive these people .
see they as they be , not for what they claim to be .
almost all of the avant guard art movement of the early 20th century ( except for italian futurism ) be label ' degenerate ' by the National Socialists .
Adolf Hitler even hold a exhibition of ' degenerate art ' in 1937 , while curate a parallel show of ' aryan ' art across the street .
the german expressionist movement be destroy as a result .
here be a quick overview of the Entartete Kunst ( Degenerate Art ) exhibit of 1937 :
ironically ( or perhaps not ) , the notion of the ' degenerate ' and ' degenerate art ' be appropriate by the Nazis and its origin can be trace back to jewish ' intellectual ' Max Nordau and a 1892 book he author call Degeneration . .
Nordau be also the co founder of the World Zionist Organization .
when the apparently cognitively functional take action that seem senseless and incompetent , it be a most certain sign that they have ulterior or hidden motive .
they trust you and I to be befuddle by they action , while they " do as they will . "
a question :
be the adherent of ' crowleyan Thelema ' and other of similar ilk appropriate or appropriate from the appropriator to redirect ' energy ? '
do this reappropriation lead to or originate from the same place ?
seem as if there be a clear distinction be make between the ' imaginary ' Whore of Babalon and the actually Whore of Babylon , which be this global system .
be the distinction accurate and valid ?
do the distinction actually exist ?
this be where the socio - political aspect of this conundrum come into play .
so , enemy , what be you point ?
why do not you state it ?
my point be that these be all just question and I be undecided as to the answer .
here be another interesting example :
John Balance from Coil .
( do not wish to use Wikipedia again , it be just easier than spend time look up more obscure and detailed information . )
Balance die in 2004 after a ' fall . '
he blend belief system such as Shamanism , Christianity , Buddhism , Paganism , Hermeticism and Gnosticism and imbue Coil 's vast output with a magickal current design to have a functionally transcendent effect on listener .
5 kg per gun , 200,000 gun mean 1000 tonne , impossible for 4 container .
if the load be 99 tonne there be probably less than 20,000 .
maybe if you formulate you question a little more specifically it will help you in acquire the answer .
" I be , therefore I think " :)

have anyone read the letter purportedly from Ahmadinejad to George Bush ?
I do not know if this have be verify .
but succintly make point after succint point , the text of the letter stand on its own merit , regardless .
I like to imagine the thought process go on in W 's head if he be to actually read the letter , but it be hard to picture he actually read this letter .
as I read the letter , I consider the vast contrast between mind and morality of whoever write it , vs. that of the mind of the man who once say " bring it on ! "
America , you condition be dire , dark and deep .

important Kos Diary about bush 's response to the gather storm of scandal :

I can not believe there be no serious metal fan who frequent RI .
I be wary of jump into this fray without backup , that be for damn sure . :)
I be a regular poster but for some reason blogger will not let I in today ... but sign I TroubleFunk .
simply , the question permeate the entire ' western ( mystery ) tradition ' and perhaps ' eastern ' as well , as they relate to the confluence of politics and spirituality .
for example , be the system of crowleyan Thelema a fail alchemical process ?
or be it suppose to initially be a process of alchemical appropriation ?
similarly , be invoke ancient egyptian god and goddess a reaffirmation of a oppressive and hierarchical system ?
in my opinion , people can no longer afford to partition out and compartmentalize personal spiritual and political system .
the ' high weirdness ' and more hardcore political ' faction ' must perhaps integrate and arrive at a synthesis .
in regards to death metal , the problem be , once again , a question of education , history and the vacuous lack of perspective in american culture .
shall we censor the work of poet charle Baudelaire as well ?
Baudelaire be perhaps one of the first ' death metal ' artist .
Tronicus , if you be still check this thread :
a bit of a knee - jerk reaction from I there , and I apologize for my over-generalization .
my real problem be with literalist fundamentalist , of any religion .
true believer be dangerous animal .
also , I be quite clear on the fact that those in power now ( and , in general , most anyone at the top of a pyrimidal power structure ) tend to use the dominant religion as a cloak to hide they true motivation and as a tool to control the mass .
it boggle the mind that anyone can take at face value Bush 's claim to be a christian , yet many seem to do just that .
I seem to remember something about ' by they work shall ye know they . "
I do get my hackles up a bit when people haul out the old ' rock - and - roll make they do it ' argument .
sub-culture ( as the lable imply ) do not develope in a vacuum .
again , I think the problem be people who sink to far into they own ego , and begin to take they personal metaphor a bit too literaly .
these people be dangerous whether they be head - bang to ' Canibal Corpse ' or hum along to ' onward Christian Soldiers ' .
( the mixing of religion and militarism be a whole other topic .... )
I have nothing but respect for people who adhear to non-violence , forgiveness , and charity , but it be important to remember that Christians ( or ' Smartwolves ' ) do not have a monopoly on that particular lifestyle .
the fact that the US government and media be have a hissy fit over Venezuela want to buy gun , and then 200,000 of the gun Chavez want to buy go missing on they way to Iraq be definitely sus .
I guess those gun will be locate enroute to Venezuela or find in storage there by one of the US 's local stooge and they then have a pretext to ramp the spin up a notch or two .
thanks again to my friend Nick Keck for pass this along via e-mail .
it be the text of a speech give by a arab gentleman before the advisory board of a large multi-nation corporation .
it be a long but very worthwhile read .
" a View from the Eye of the Storm "
talk deliver by Haim Harari at a meeting of the International Advisory Board of a large multi-national corporation , April , 2004 :
" as you know , I usually provide the scientific and technological " entertainment " in we meeting , but , on this occasion , we Chairman suggest that I present my own personal view on event in the part of the world from which I come .
I have never be and I will never be a government official and I have no privileged information .
my perspective be entirely base on what I see , on what I read and on the fact that my family have live in this region for almost 200 year .
you may regard my view as those of the proverbial taxi driver , which you be suppose to question , when you visit a country .
I could have share with you some fascinating fact and some personal thought about the israeli - arab conflict .
however , I will touch upon it only in passing .
I prefer to devote most of my remark to the broader picture of the region and its place in world event .
I refer to the entire area between Pakistan and Morocco , which be predominantly arab , predominantly moslem , but include many non-arab and also significant non-moslem minority .
why do I put aside Israel and its own immediate neighborhood ?
because Israel and any problem related to it , in spite of what you might read or hear in the world media , be not the central issue , and have never be the central issue in the upheaval in the region .
yes , there be a 100 year - old israeli - arab conflict , but it be not where the main show be .
the million who die in the Iran - Iraq war have nothing to do with Israel .
the mass murder happen right now in Sudan , where the arab moslem regime be massacre its black christian citizen , have nothing to do with Israel .
the frequent report from Algeria about the murder of hundred of civilian in one village or another by other Algerians have nothing to do with Israel .
Saddam Hussein do not invade Kuwait , endanger Saudi Arabia and butcher he own people because of Israel .
Egypt do not use poison gas against Yemen in the 60' because of Israel .
Assad the Father do not kill ten of thousand of he own citizen in one week in El Hamma in Syria because of Israel .
the Taliban control of Afghanistan and the civil war there have nothing to do with Israel .
the libyan blowing up of the Pan - Am flight have nothing to do with Israel , and I could go on and on and on .
the root of the trouble be that this entire moslem region be totally dysfunctional , by any standard of the word , and would have be so even if Israel have join the Arab league and a independent Palestine have exist for 100 year .
the 22 member country of the Arab league , from Mauritania to the Gulf States , have a total population of 300 million , larger than the US and almost as large as the EU before its expansion .
they have a land area larger than either the US or all of Europe .
these 22 country , with all they oil and natural resource , have a combine GDP smaller than that of Netherlands plus Belgium and equal to half of the GDP of California alone .
within this meager GDP , the gap between rich and poor be beyond belief and too many of the rich make they money not by succeed in business , but by be corrupt ruler .
the social status of woman be far below what it be in the Western World 150 year ago .
human rights be below any reasonable standard , in spite of the grotesque fact that Libya be elect chair of the UN Human Rights commission .
accord to a report prepare by a committee of arab intellectual and publish under the auspices of the U.N. , the number of book translate by the entire arab world be much smaller than what little Greece alone translate .
the total number of scientific publication of 300 million Arabs be less than that of 6 million Israelis .
birth rate in the region be very high , increase the poverty , the social gap and the cultural decline .
and all of this be happen in a region , which only 30 year ago , be believe to be the next wealthy part of the world , and in a moslem area , which develop , at some point in history , one of the most advanced culture in the world .
it be fair to say that this create a unprecedented breeding ground for cruel dictator , terror network , fanaticism , incitement , suicide murder and general decline .
it be also a fact that almost everybody in the region blame this situation on the United States , on Israel , on western civilization , on Judaism and Christianity , on anyone and anything , except themselves .
a word about the million of decent , honest , good people who be either devout Moslems or be not very religious but grow up in moslem family : they be double victim of a outside world , which now develop islamophobia , and of they own environment which break they heart by be totally dysfunctional .
the problem be that the vast silent majority of these Moslems be not part of the terror and the incitement , but they also do not stand up against it .
they become accomplice , by omission , and this apply to political leader , intellectual , business people and many other .
many of they can certainly tell right from wrong , but be afraid to express they view .
the event of the last few year have amplify four issue , which have always exist , but have never be as rampant as in the present upheaval in the region .
a few more year may pass before everybody acknowledge that it be a World War , but we be already well into it .
these be the four main pillar of the current world conflict , or perhaps we should already refer to it as " the undeclared World War III " :
suicide murder be not a new invention but they have be make popular , if I may use this expression , only lately .
even after September 11 , it seem that most of the Western World do not yet understand this weapon .
it be a very potent psychological weapon .
its real direct impact be relatively minor .
the total number of casualty from hundred of suicide murder within Israel in the last three year be much smaller than those due to car accident .
September 11 be quantitatively much less lethal than many earthquake
so what be all the fuss about suicide killing ?
it create headline .
it be spectacular .
it be frightening .
it be a very cruel death with body dismember and horrible severe lifelong injury to many of the wounded .
it be always show on television in great detail .
one such murder , with the help of hysterical media coverage , can destroy the tourism industry of a country for quite a while , as it do in Bali and in Turkey .
but the real fear come from the undisputed fact that no defense and no preventive measure can succeed against a determined suicide murderer .
this have not yet penetrate the thinking of the Western World .
the U.S. and Europe be constantly improve they defense against the last murder , not the next one .
we may arrange for the best airport security in the world .
but if you want to murder by suicide , you do not have to board a plane in order to explode yourself and kill many people .
who could stop a suicide murder in the midst of the crowded line wait to be check by the airport metal detector ?
how about the line to the check - in counter in a busy travel period ?
put a metal detector in front of every train station in Spain and the terrorist will get the bus .
protect the bus and they will explode in movie theater , concert hall , supermarket , shopping mall , school and hospital .
you can somewhat reduce you vulnerability by preventive and defensive measure and by strict border controls but not eliminate it and definitely not win the war in a defensive way .
and it be a war !
what be behind the suicide murder ?
money be , money and power and cold - blooded murderous incitement , nothing else .
it have nothing to do with true fanatic religious belief .
no moslem preacher have ever blow himself up .
no son of a arab politician or religious leader have ever blow himself up .
no relative of anyone influential have do it .
would not you expect some of the religious leader to do it themselves , or to talk they son into do it , if this be truly a supreme act of religious fervor ?
be not they interested in the benefit of go to Heaven ?
instead , they send outcast woman , naive child , retarded people and young incite hothead .
they promise they the delight , mostly sexual , of the next world , and pay they family handsomely after the supreme act be perform and enough innocent people be dead .
suicide murder also have nothing to do with poverty and despair .
the poorest region in the world , by far , be Africa .
it never happen there .
there be numerous desperate people in the world , in different culture , country and continent .
desperation do not provide anyone with explosive , reconnaissance and transportation .
a suicide murder be simply a horrible , vicious weapon of cruel , inhuman , cynical , well - fund terrorist , with no regard to human life , include the life of they fellow countryman , but with very high regard to they own affluent well - being and they hunger for power .
the only way to fight this new " popular " weapon be identical to the only way in which you fight organized crime or pirate on the high seas : the offensive way .
like in the case of organized crime , it be crucial that the force on the offensive be united and it be crucial to reach the top of the crime pyramid .
you can not eliminate organized crime by arrest the little drug dealer on the street corner .
you must go after the head of the " family " .
if part of the public support it , other tolerate it , many be afraid of it and some try to explain it away by poverty or by a miserable childhood , organized crime will thrive and so will terrorism .
the United States understand this now , after September 11 .
Russia be begin to understand it .
Turkey understand it well .
I be very much afraid that most of Europe still do not understand it .
unfortunately , it seem that Europe will understand it only after suicide murder arrive in Europe in a big way .
in my humble opinion , this will definitely happen .
the spanish train and the Istanbul bombing be only the beginning .
the unity of the civilized world in fight this horror be absolutely indispensable .
until Europe wake up , this unity will not be achieve .
word can be lethal .
they kill people .
it be often say that politician , diplomat and perhaps also lawyer and business people must sometimes lie , as part of they professional life .
but the norm of politics and diplomacy be childish , in comparison with the level of incitement and total absolute deliberate fabrication , which have reach new height in the region we be talk about .
a incredible number of people in the arab world believe that September 11 never happen , or be a american provocation or , even better , a jewish plot .
you all remember the iraqi Minister of Information , Mr. Mouhamad Said al - Sahaf and he press conference when the US force be already inside Baghdad .
disinformation at time of war be a accept tactic .
but to stand , day after day , and to make such preposterous statement , known to everybody to be lie , without even be ridicule in you own milieu , can only happen in this region .
Mr. Sahaf eventually become a popular icon as a court jester , but this do not stop some allegedly respectable newspaper from give he equal time .
it also do not prevent the western press from give credence , every day , even now , to similar liar .
after all , if you want to be a anti-semite , there be subtle way of do it .
you do not have to claim that the holocaust never happen , and that the jewish temple in Jerusalem never exist .
but million of Moslems be tell by they leader that this be the case .
when these same leader make other statement , the western media report they as if they could be true .
it be a daily occurrence that the same people who finance , arm and dispatch suicide murderer , condemn the act in English in front of western tv camera , talk to a world audience , which even partly believe they .
it be a daily routine to hear the same leader make opposite statement in Arabic to he people and in English to the rest of the world .
incitement by arab tv , accompany by horror picture of mutilate body , have become a powerful weapon of those who lie , distort and want to destroy everything .
little child be raise on deep hatred and on admiration of so - call martyr , and the western world do not notice it because its own tv set be mostly tune to soap opera and game show .
I recommend to you , even though most of you do not understand Arabic , to watch Al Jazeera , from time to time .
you will not believe you own eye .
but word also work in other way , more subtle .
a demonstration in Berlin , carry banner support Saddam 's regime and feature three - year old baby dress as suicide murderer , be define by the press and by political leader as a " peace demonstration " .
you may support or oppose the Iraq war , but to refer to fan of Saddam , Arafat or Bin Laden as peace activist be a bit too much .
a woman walk into a israeli restaurant in mid-day , eat , observe family with old people and child eat they lunch in the adjacent table and pay the bill .
she then blow herself up , kill 20 people , include many child , with head and arm roll around in the restaurant .
dignitary condemn the act but visit she bereaved family and the money flow .
there be a new game in town : the actual murderer be call " the military wing " , the one who pay he , equip he and send he be now call " the political wing " and the head of the operation be call the " spiritual leader " .
there be numerous other example of such orwellian nomenclature , use every day not only by terror chiefs but also by western media .
these word be much more dangerous than many people realize .
they provide a emotional infrastructure for atrocity .
it be Joseph Goebbels who say that if you repeat a lie often enough , people will believe it .
he be now be outperform by he successor .
huge amount of money , which could have solve many social problem in this dysfunctional part of the world , be channel into three concentric sphere support death and murder .
in the inner circle be the terrorist themselves .
the money fund they travel , explosive , hideout and permanent search for soft vulnerable target .
the inner circle be primarily finance by terrorist state like Iran and Syria , until recently also by Iraq and Libya and earlier also by some of the communist regime .
these state , as well as the Palestinian Authority , be the safe haven of the wholesale murder vendor .
they be surround by a second wider circle of direct supporter , planner , commander , preacher , all of whom make a living , usually a very comfortable living , by serve as terror infrastructure .
finally , we find the third circle of so - call religious , educational and welfare organization , which actually do some good , feed the hungry and provide some schooling , but brainwash a new generation with hatred , lie and ignorance .
this circle operate mostly through mosque , madrasa and other religious establishment but also through incite electronic and print media .
it be this circle that make sure that woman remain inferior , that democracy be unthinkable and that exposure to the outside world be minimal .
it be also that circle that lead the way in blame everybody outside the moslem world , for the misery of the region .
the outer circle be largely finance by Saudi Arabia , but also by donation from certain moslem community in the United States and Europe and , to a smaller extent , by donation of european government to various ngo' and by certain United Nations organization , whose goal may be noble , but they be infest and exploit by agent of the outer circle .
the saudi regime , of course , will be the next victim of major terror , when the inner circle will explode into the outer circle .
the Saudis be begin to understand it , but they fight the inner circle , while still finance the infrastructure at the outer circle .
figuratively speak , this outer circle be the guardian , which make sure that the people look and listen inwards to the inner circle of terror and incitement , rather than to the world outside .
some part of this same outer circle actually operate as a result of fear from , or blackmail by , the inner circle .
the horrifying add factor be the high birth rate .
half of the population of the arab world be under the age of 20 , the most receptive age to incitement , guarantee two more generation of blind hatred .
some of the leader of these various circle live very comfortably on they loot .
the jihad " soldier " join package death tour to Iraq and other hotspot , while some of they leader ski in Switzerland .
Mrs. Arafat , who live in Paris with she daughter , receive ten of thousand of dollar per month from the allegedly bankrupt Palestinian Authority , while a typical local ringleader of the Al - Aksa brigade , report to Arafat , receive only a cash payment of a couple of hundred dollar , for perform murder at the retail level .
the civilized world believe in democracy , the rule of law , include international law , human rights , free speech and free press , among other liberty .
there be naive old - fashioned habit such as respect religious site and symbol , not use ambulance and hospital for act of war , avoid the mutilation of dead body and not use child as human shield or human bomb .
every student of political science debate how you prevent a anti-democratic force from win a democratic election and abolish democracy .
other aspect of a civilized society must also have limitation .
can a policeman open fire on someone try to kill he ?
can a government listen to phone conversation of terrorist and drug dealer ?
do free speech protect you when you shout " fire " in a crowded theater ?
should there be death penalty , for deliberate multiple murder ?
these be the old - fashioned dilemma .
but now we have a entire new set .
do you raid a mosque , which serve as a terrorist ammunition storage ?
do you return fire , if you be attack from a hospital ?
do you storm a church take over by terrorist who take the priest hostage ?
do you search every ambulance after a few suicide murderer use ambulance to reach they target ?
do you strip every woman because one pretend to be pregnant and carry a suicide bomb on she belly ?
do you shoot back at someone try to kill you , stand deliberately behind a group of child ?
do you raid terrorist headquarters , hide in a mental hospital ?
do you shoot a arch-murderer who deliberately move from one location to another , always surround by child ?
all of these happen daily in Iraq and in the palestinian area .
what do you do ?
well , you do not want to face the dilemma .
but it can not be avoid .
suppose , for the sake of discussion , that someone would openly stay in a well - known address in Teheran , host by the iranian government and finance by it , execute one atrocity after another in Spain or in France , kill hundred of innocent people , accept responsibility for the crime , promise in public tv interview to do more of the same , while the government of Iran issue public condemnation of he act but continue to host he , invite he to official function and treat he as a great dignitary .
I leave it to you as homework to figure out what Spain or France would have do , in such a situation .
the problem be that the civilized world be still have illusion about the rule of law in a totally lawless environment .
it be try to play ice hockey by send a ballerina ice - skater into the ring or to knock out a heavyweight boxer by a chess player .
in the same way that no country have a law against cannibal eat its prime minister , because such a act be unthinkable , international law do not address killer shoot from hospital , mosque and ambulance , while be protect by they government or society .
international law do not know how to handle someone who send child to throw stone , stand behind they and shoot with immunity and can not be arrest because he be shelter by a government .
international law do not know how to deal with a leader of murderer who be royally and comfortably host by a country , which pretend to condemn he act or just claim to be too weak to arrest he .
the amazing thing be that all of these crook demand protection under international law , and define all those who attack they as " war criminal , " with some western media repeat the allegation .
the good news be that all of this be temporary , because the evolution of international law have always adapt itself to reality .
the punishment for suicide murder should be death or arrest before the murder , not during and not after .
after every world war , the rule of international law have change , and the same will happen after the present one .
but during the twilight zone , a lot of harm can be do .
the picture I describe here be not pretty .
what can we do about it ?
in the short run , only fight and win .
in the long run , only educate the next generation and open it to the world .
the inner circle can and must be destroy by force .
the outer circle can not be eliminate by force .
here we need financial starvation of the organize elite , more power to woman , more education , counter-propaganda , boycott whenever feasible and access to western media , internet and the international scene .
above all , we need a total absolute unity and determination of the civilized world against all three circle of evil .
allow I , for a moment , to depart from my alleged role as a taxi driver and return to science .
when you have a malignant tumor , you may remove the tumor itself surgically .
you may also starve it by prevent new blood from reach it from other part of the body , thereby prevent new " supplies " from expand the tumor .
if you want to be sure , it be best to do both .
in order to win , it be necessary to first eliminate the terrorist regime , so that no government in the world will serve as a safe haven for these people .
I do not want to comment here on whether the american - lead attack on Iraq be justified from the point of view of weapon of mass destruction or any other pre-war argument , but I can look at the post-war map of western Asia .
perhaps Sudan should be add to the list .
as a result of the conquest of Afghanistan and Iraq , both Iran and Syria be now totally surround by territory unfriendly to they .
Iran be encircle by Afghanistan , by the Gulf States , Iraq and the moslem republic of the former Soviet Union .
Syria be surround by Turkey , Iraq , Jordan and Israel .
this be a significant strategic change and it apply strong pressure on the terrorist country .
it be not surprising that Iran be so active in try to incite a shiite uprising in Iraq .
I do not know if the american plan be actually to encircle both Iran and Syria , but that be the result situation .
in my humble opinion , the number one danger to the world today be Iran and its regime .
it definitely have ambition to rule vast area and to expand in all direction .
it have a ideology which claim supremacy over western culture .
it be ruthless .
it have prove that it can execute elaborate terrorist act without leave too many trace , use iranian Embassies .
it be clearly try to develop nuclear weapon .
its so - call moderate and conservative play they own virtuoso version of the " good - cop versus bad - cop " game .
Iran sponsor syrian terrorism , it be certainly behind much of the action in Iraq , it be fully fund the Hezbollah and , through it , the palestinian Hamas and Islamic Jihad ; it perform act of terror at least in Europe and in South America and probably also in Uzbekistan and Saudi Arabia and it truly lead a multi-national terror consortium , which include , as minor player , Syria , Lebanon and certain shiite element in Iraq .
nevertheless , most european country still trade with Iran , try to appease it and refuse to read the clear signal .
in order to win the war it be also necessary to dry the financial resource of the terror conglomerate .
it be pointless to try to understand the subtle difference between the sunni terror of Al Qaeda and Hamas and the shiite terror of Hezbollah , Sadr and other iranian - inspire enterprise .
when it serve they business need , all of they collaborate beautifully .
it be crucial to stop saudi and other financial support of the outer circle , which be the fertile breeding ground of terror .
it be important to monitor all donation from the western world to islamic organization , to monitor the finances of international relief organization and to react with forceful economic measure to any small sign of financial aid to any of the three circle of terrorism .
it be also important to act decisively against the campaign of lie and fabrication and to monitor those western media who collaborate with it out of naivety , financial interest or ignorance .
above all , never surrender to terror .
no one will ever know whether the recent election in Spain would have yield a different result , if not for the train bombing a few day earlier .
but it really do not matter .
what matter be that the terrorist believe that they cause the result and that they win by drive Spain out of Iraq .
the spanish story will surely end up be extremely costly to other european country , include France , who be now expel incite preacher and forbid veil and include other who send troops to Iraq .
in the long run , Spain itself will pay even more .
be the solution a democratic arab world ?
if by democracy we mean free election but also free press , free speech , a function judicial system , civil liberty , equality to woman , free international travel , exposure to international media and idea , law against racial incitement and against defamation , and avoidance of lawless behavior regard hospital , place of worship and child , then yes , democracy be the solution .
if democracy be just free election , it be likely that the most fanatic regime will be elect , the one whose incitement and fabrication be the most inflammatory .
we have see it already in Algeria and , to a certain extent , in Turkey .
it will happen again , if the ground be not prepare very carefully .
on the other hand , a certain transition democracy , as in Jordan , may be a better temporary solution , pave the way for the real thing , perhaps in the same way that a immediate sudden democracy do not work in Russia and would not have work in China .
I have no doubt that the civilized world will prevail .
Europe , more than any other region , be the key .
its understandable recoil from war , follow the horror of World War II , may cost thousand of additional innocent life , before the tide will turn . "
Zawahiri be associate with a faction of the Egyptian Islamic Jihad know as the Vanguards of Conquest .
Zawahiri and the Vanguards of Conquest be seek to recreate Mohammed 's taking of mecca by a small band through violent attack on egyptian leader .
by 1998 , Zawahiri have determine that the Egyptian Islamic Jihad should focus on its struggle against the United States and hold off on further attack against the egyptian regime .
a key question be how they acquire the anthrax strain first isolate by the Texas Veterinary Medical Diagnostic Lab in 1980 .
accord to senior counter terrorism official , both here and abroad , among the supporter of these militant islamist be people who blend into society and be available to act when another part of the network request it .
Al Qaeda , Anthrax and Ayman : means , motive , modus operandi and opportunity
in early June 2003 , a Central Intelligence Agency ( " CIA " ) report publicly disclose that the reason for Mohammed Atta 's and Zacarias Moussaoui 's inquiry into cropduster be for the contemplate use in disperse biological agent such as anthrax .
a early September 2003 Newsweek article include a rumor by a Taliban source that at a meeting in April 2003 Bin Laden be plan a " unbelievable " biological attack , the plan for which have suffer a setback upon the arrest of Khalid Shaikh Mohammed ( " KSM " ) .
he have be capture the previous month in Rawalpindi , Pakistan .
in November 2003 , a report by a UN panel of expert conclude that Al Qaeda be determined to use chemical and biological weapon and be restrain only by technical difficulty .
in a statement issue June 16 , 2004 , the 9/11 Commission staff conclude that " Al Qaeda have a ambitious biological weapon program and be make advance in its ability to produce anthrax prior to September 11 .
accord to Director of Central Intelligence George Tenet , al Qaeda 's ability to conduct a anthrax attack be one of the most immediate threat the United States be likely to face . "
on August 9 , 2004 , it be announce that in the spring of 2001 , a man name El - Shukrijumah , also know as Jafar the Pilot , who be part of a " second wave , " have be case New York City helicopter .
photograph from a seize computer disc include the control and the lock on the door between the passenger and pilot .
in a bulletin , the FBI note that the surveillance might relate to a plot to disperse a chemical or biological weapon .
the CIA reportedly have be quietly build a case that the anthrax mailing be a international plot .
this be old news .
it be just no longer bureaucratically impolite to openly contest the FBI 's ( former ) theory about a lone , american scientist .
many people have argue that a US - base Al Qaeda operative be behind the earlier fall 2001 anthrax mailing in the US , and that the mailing serve as a threat and warning .
Princeton islamist scholar Bernard Lewis have explain that while islamist may disagree about whether kill innocent be sanction by the law of jihad , extremist like Zawahiri agree that notice must be give before biochemical weapon be use .
the letter bomb be send in connection with the detention of the blind sheik Abdel Rahman and those responsible for the earlier World Trade Center bombing in 1993 .
handwritten note and file on a laptop seize upon the capture of KSM , Al Qaeda 's # 3 , include a feasible anthrax production plan use a spray dryer and address the recruitment of necessary expertise .
what you morning paper do not tell you , however , be that the CIA seize a similar disc from Ayman Zawahiri 's right - hand , Ahmed Salama Mabruk , 5 year earlier .
the computer disk be confiscate from he during he arrest by the CIA in Azerbaijan and hand over to the egyptian authority .
Mabruk , at the time , be the head of Jihad 's military operation .
there be a risk that observer underestimate the time that Al Qaeda have have to make progress in such recruitment and research and development .
some may still think that even in the final stage of the 9/11 plot , Zacarias Moussaoui be go to fly a 5th plane into the Capitol or White House .
other argue that he be to be part of a second wave of airliner direct to target on the west coast .
in March 2003 , Mohammed reportedly say that Moussaoui be not go to be part of 9/11 but be to be part of a " second wave . "
although Ramzi Binalshibh provide he $ 14,000 in July , accuse September 11 conspirator Zacarias Moussaoui tell he trial judge that he have a al Qaeda mission that would have come after the terrorist attack .
KSM explain that Moussaoui 's inquiry about crop duster may have be related to the anthrax work be do by US - train biochemist and Al Qaeda operative , malaysian Yazid Sufaat .
Zacarias Moussaoui , never the sharpest tool in the shed and think by he superior to be unreliable , have tell the judge at he trial in a filing that he want " anthrax for Jew sympathizer only . "
Al Qaeda 's regional operative , Hambali , who be at a key January 2000 meeting and supervise Sufaat , have be capture .
Hambali reportedly be cooperate to some degree .
KSM and Hambali send al - Hindi ( al - Britani ) , along with Jafar the Pilot , to case NYC target for a second wave .
it be as part of that surveillance in early 2001 that Jafar the Pilot study tourist helicopter in the NYC area .
Sufaat , accord to both KSM and Hambali , do not have the virulent US Army Ames strain that would be use .
that would require someone who have access to the strain .
but if experience be any guide , nothing would stand in the way of Dr. Ayman Zawahiri 's decade - long quest to weaponize and use anthrax against US target that be describe by one confidante to a egyptian newspaper reporter .
the islamist have be release from egyptian prison and have know Zawahiri well for many year .
email from Zawahiri to Atef in the spring of 1999 indicate that Ayman be a close student of the USAMRIID anthrax program .
he believe that the koran instruct that a jihadist should use the weapon use by the crusader .
" what we know be that he have always say it be a religious obligation to have the same weapon as they enemy , " former CIA OBL unit counter terrorism chief Michael Scheuer have say .
Zawahiri be associate with a faction of the Egyptian Islamic Jihad know as the Vanguards of Conquest .
Zawahiri and the Vanguards of Conquest be seek to recreate Mohammed 's taking of mecca by a small band through violent attack on egyptian leader .
by 1998 , Zawahiri have determine that the Egyptian Islamic Jihad should focus on its struggle against the United States and hold off on further attack against the egyptian regime .
a key question be how they acquire the anthrax strain first isolate by the Texas Veterinary Medical Diagnostic Lab in 1980 .
accord to senior counter terrorism official , both here and abroad , among the supporter of these militant islamist be people who blend into society and be available to act when another part of the network request it .
a few day before Christmas 2003 , after a renew audiotape threat by Zawahiri of attack , to include in the US homeland , the threat level be raise to orange or " high . "
after the alert condition have long since return to yellow , Zawahiri in late February issue another audiotape .
he urge the President that brigade and brigade would be come under the banner of jihad carry death and seek paradise .
Zawahiri say that the US should expect another 9/11 on US soil .
accord to some report , Zawahiri be think by intelligence to be somewhere near the border of Pakistan and Afghanistan .
at one time , some think he have be spot in Iran .
wherever he be , authority need to focus on the traceable connection between he and those he or Atef recruit .
in October 2001 , do the FBI profiler know of the draft message Khalid Mohammed have on the seize laptop ( from 1995 ) that be sign " Khalid Sheik Bojinka " ?
the letter threaten to use biochemical weapon if the blind sheik be not release .
( Khalid Mohammed 's involvement date back to Bojinka , as do Hambali 's ) .
use of biochemical weapon as blackmail and threaten retaliation for such detention be a alternative scenario in the Bojinka planning .
in May 2004 , Patrick Hughes , Lieutenant General ( retired ) , Assistant Secretary for Information Analysis , Homeland Security Department testify before the 9/11 Commission .
he explain that interrogation and other evidence reveal that Al Qaeda want to strike the US with a nonconventional weapon , most notably anthrax .
the same week , the WTC head testify that while they have not receive any briefing on the use of plane , they have take step to prepare for a attack use anthrax base on intelligence that have be receive .
Al Qaeda have have anthrax , the raw seed product in its unweaponized form , since at least 1997 , when it be purchase by Bin Laden through the Moro Islamic Liberation Front ( " Moro Front " or " MILF " ) .
Zawahiri , Al Qaeda 's # 2 , be head of Al Qaeda 's biochemical program .
the CIA have know of Zawahiri 's plan to use anthrax for a half decade .
the confidante and right - hand man of Dr. Ayman Zawahiri admit that Zawahiri succeed in obtain anthrax and intend to use it against US target .
another senior Al Qaeda member ( a shura or policy - make council member no less ) be work for the egyptian intelligence service and he confirm the report in a swear lengthy confession .
even Zawahiri 's attorney in 1999 say that Bin Laden and Zawahiri be likely to resort to the biological and chemical agent they possess give the extradition pressure senior Al Qaeda leader face .
a recently release islamist who have be a close associate of Zawahiri say that Zawahiri spend a decade and have make 15 separate attempt to recruit the necessary expertise to weaponize anthrax in Russia and the Middle East .
the US Army recipe be not use , and obtain the unprocessed Ames strain of anthrax use do not warrant the weight give it by some press account .
there be lax control over the distribution of the Ames strain that be use , especially in light of the fact that transfer be not even require to be record prior to 1997 .
significantly , the individual who isolate it nearly a quarter century ago ( now retired ) , upon be contact , do not even report that he necessarily send the only copy of the strain to Ft. Detrick .
Senator Patrick Leahy at a congressional hearing in the spring of 2002 note that the FBI have collect the Ames strain from 20 source .
in fall 2004 , MSNBC , rely on a unnamed FBI spokesperson , report that the FBI have narrow the pool of lab know to have have Ames that be a match from 16 to 4 but can not rule out that it be make overseas .
Al Qaeda 's anthrax production plan on Khalid Mohammed 's computer do not evidence knowledge of advanced technique in the most efficient biological weapon .
in the case of the anthrax use in the mailing , there be a electrostatic charge .
( spore must be no bigger than 5 micron to be inhalable . )
many point to the trillion spore concentration as extraordinary .
it be far simpler , however , to achieve a trillion spore concentration in the production of a few gram than in industrial processing typical of a state sponsor lab .
the " trillion spore " issue be at the heart of a lot of mistaken theory of the matter conclude that state sponsorship be necessarily indicate .
the report finding at Dugway undermine the argument of both the " bomb Iraq " crowd and the liberal focused on Dr. Steve Hatfill who object to US biodefense research because they view it as be useful for offensive purpose .
USDA employee Johnelle Bryant first tell we , in sensational detail , of Atta 's inquiry about purchase and retrofit a cropduster .
Khalid Mohammed then tell interrogator that Zacarias Moussaoui 's inquiry about crop dusting may have relate to Yazid Sufaat 's anthrax manufacturing plan .
Al Qaeda have both the means and opportunity .
US - train malaysian biochemist Yazid Sufaat meet with 9/11 plotter and two hijacker in January 2000 .
Sufaat be a member of Al Qaeda and a member of Jemaah Islamiah ( " JI " ) .
JI have tie with the Moro Front .
Sufaat use he company call Green Laboratory Medicine to buy item useful to Al Qaeda .
( green symbolize " Islam " and Prophet Mohammed 's holy war ) .
Zacarias Moussaoui , who have a crop dusting manual when he be arrest , stay at Sufaat 's condominium in 2000 when he be try to arrange for flight lesson in Malaysia .
Yazid Sufaat provide Moussaoui with a letter indicate that he be a marketing representative for Infocus Technologies and allegedly provide he $ 35,000 .
the crop duster be to be part of a " second wave . "
after 9/11 , Yazid Sufaat travel to Afghanistan and Pakistan to work for the Taliban Medical Brigade and to continue he work with anthrax .
as describe in US News , a former reporter from the Kabul Times actually may have meet Sufaat , without realize it , while travel near Kabul in October 2001 , perceive he as filipino .
the fellow be carry papers from Zawahiri and brag about he ability to manipulate anthrax .
Sufaat be arrest in December 2001 upon he return to Malaysia .
Newsweek report that a " second wave " involve biological attack have be thwart upon the arrest of Al Qaeda member who have be intend to provide logistical support .
microbiologist Abdul Qadoos Khan be charge along with he son , Ahmed , for harbor the fugitive .
as of March 28 , 2003 , he be in a hospital for a cardiac problem and have be grant " pre-arrest bail . "
yet all you read about at the time be the arrest of the son Ahmed Abdul Qadoos , who receive a stipend from the UN for be officially low - iq due to lead poisoning .
the pakistani press report that she be nab in Karachi after be spot at the airport in late March or early April 2003 .
if mistaken , how do those report first come about ?
understandably , Amerithrax be a confidential investigation .
the Pakistan ISI and CIA rarely grant press interview in connection with a ongoing manhunt .
the CIA do not even allow the FBI access to KSM for 10 day after he arrest .
as agent Van Harp , then head of the Amerithrax investigation say , the information come from Khalid Mohammed be classified with the authority release only certain limited information .
while it be not easy to separate fact from fiction , Attorney General Ashcroft and Director Mueller have publicly confirm Aafia be still be seek .
they would know .
she mother Ismat last see Aafia and she grandchild before they leave in a minicab at the end of March .
Aafia be on she way with she child to visit a uncle and a friend in Islamabad .
accord to the Pakistan report , Aafia Siddiqui be detain after be spot at Karachi International airport ( after she be follow to a relative 's house ) .
( Karachi be in the south ) .
the report say she be suspect of have be a member of Al Qaeda 's " Chemical Wire Group . "
that be the last Ismat hear from she .
Aafia never reach the uncle 's house .
perhaps something get lost in the translation , but the phrase " Chemical Wire Group " have appear in all the english Pakistan and India papers .
the family 's attorney advise I that Aafia have no knowledge of chemical ( and that would not appear to be she training ) .
there still be a very hot pursuit of the " Atta - level " Floridian , Adnan El Shukrijumah , who Siddiqui be think to have know and be assist .
he nickname be " Jafar the Pilot . "
a senior DOJ official report that Adnan have experience as a commercial pilot .
he be say by one FBI agent to be " very , very , very " dangerous .
he allegedly be at one or more meeting in the summer of 2001 in Pakistan at which KSM and Sufaat be present .
he may have be see in Hamilton , Canada -- along with Egyptian al - Maati , who apparently also have receive pilot training .
the United States truly no longer have time for faulty analysis or politically - base preconception .
in early June 2003 , a CIA report conclude that the reason for Atta 's and Zacarias Moussaoui 's inquiry into cropduster be in fact for the contemplate use in disperse biological agent such as anthrax .
it have long be know Osama Bin Laden be interested in use cropduster to disperse biological agent ( since the testimony of millennium bomber Ahmed Ressam ) .
the hijacker Ahmed Alhaznawi appear to have contract cutaneous anthrax in Afghanistan .
it be reasonable to credit he statement that he get the lesion after bump into a suitcase he be carry at a camp in Afghanistan .
the lesion be further evidence of Al Qaeda 's anthrax production program at Kandahar .
the present evidence relate to Atta 's alleged travel to Prague do not warrant a conclusion that Al Qaeda obtain the Ames strain from Iraq .
Iraq , however , remain a possible source of the Ames .
former russian bioweaponeer Ken Alibek have say that a key russian scientist assist Iraq and that Russia have the Ames strain .
( he conclusion may have be base on the fake mobile biolab plan foist upon the US by the Chalabi associate " Curveball " , which Alibek divine to be identical to russian mobile lab design ) .
Zawahiri do travel to Baghdad in 1998 with a entourage to attend the birthday party of Saddam 's son .
the papers find at headquarters of the Mukhabarat , Iraq 's secret police , show that a entourage from Al Qaeda group be send to the iraqi capital in March 1998 from Sudan .
accord to at least some report , Bin Laden reject the suggestion of a closer alliance -- prefer to pursue he own concept of jihad .
two top iraqi scientist , code name Charlie and Alpha , be help the coalition to learn more about Iraqi 's anthrax program , accord to Dr. David Kay , head of the Iraq survey group in charge of the hunt for WMD .
he have say that the Iraqis make surprising innovation in the milling and drying process need to weaponize anthrax .
the media coverage have be seriously confused on the issue of motive and the reason Senators Daschle and Leahy would have be target -- tend to simplistically view they as " liberal . "
Zawahiri likely target Senators Daschle and Leahy to receive anthrax letter , in addition to various media outlet , because of the appropriation make pursuant to the " Leahy Law " to military and security force .
that money have prevent the militant islamist from achieve they goal .
Al Qaeda member and sympathizer feel that the FBI 's involvement in country like Egypt , Saudi Arabia , Pakistan , Indonesia , and the Philippines interfere with the sovereignty of those country .
accord to a post she make on the internet , Aafia Siddiqui express the same sentiment in connection with US appropriation seek in exchange for the extradition of WTC 1993 plotter Ramzi Yousef from Pakistan .
Senator Leahy be chairman of both the Judiciary Committee oversee the FBI and Appropriations Subcommittee in charge of foreign aid to these country .
in late September 2001 , it be announce that the President be seek a blanket waiver that would lift all restriction on aid to military and security unit in connection with pursue the militant islamist .
this extradition and imprisonment of Al Qaeda leader , along with US support for Israel and the Mubarak government in Egypt , remain foremost in the mind of Dr. Zawahiri .
at the height of the development of he biological weapon program , he brother be extradite pursuant to a death sentence in the " albanian returnee " case ( now he face retrial ) .
it be hard to keep up with the story about billion dollar appropriation , debt forgiveness , and loan guarantee to country like Egypt and Israel and now even Pakistan .
those appropriation pale in comparison to the many ten of billion in appropriation relate to the invasion of Iraq .
Al Qaeda have a motive in mind .
in he fall 2001 book title Knights under the Banner of the Prophet , Zawahiri argue that the secular press be tell " lie " about the militant islamist -- to include the suggestion that the militant islamist be somehow the creation of the United States in connection with expel the Russians from Afghanistan .
Zawahiri argue instead that they have be active since the assassination of Anwar Sadat in Egypt because of the Camp David Accord and the result peace treaty between Egypt and Israel .
the anthrax letter be send on the date of the Camp David Accord and then the date Anwar Sadat be assassinate as if to underscore the point to anyone pay attention .
most of the " talk head " on television , however , know only that Daschle and Leahy be liberal democrat and do not know anything of Al Qaeda beyond what they read in the US newspaper .
the FBI 's profile include a US - base supporter of the militant islamist .
Attorney General Ashcroft explain that a " either - or " approach be not useful .
the media have tend to overlook the fact that when the FBI use the word " domestic " the word include a US - base , highly - educated supporter of the militant islamist .
there be a emerge consensus that anthrax be contain in a letter to AMI , the publisher of the National Enquirer -- in a goofy love letter to Jennifer Lopez enclose a Star of David and propose marriage .
a report by the Center for Disease Control of interview with AMI employee ( as well as detailed interview by author Leonard Cole ) support the conclusion that there be not one , but two , such mailing contain anthrax .
( the letter be to different AMI publication -- one to the National Enquirer and another to the Sun ) .
( news assistant Bobby Bender recall the letter contain the item to have be address to the Sun . )
this tactic of letter be not merely the modus operandi of these militant islamist inspire by Zawahiri , it be they signature .
the islamist send letter bomb in January 1997 to newspaper office in New York City and Washington , D.C. .
they be send in connection with the earlier bombing of the World Trade Center and the imprisonment of the blind sheik , Sheik Abdel Rahman .
the letter bomb be send in connection with the treatment of the egyptian islamist imprison for the earlier attack on the WTC and a related plot .
the purpose of the letter bomb -- which result in minimal casualty -- be to send a message .
there be no claim of responsibility .
there be no explanation .
once one have be receive , the next ten , mail on two separate date , be easily collect .
sound familiar ?
two bomb be also send to Leavenworth , where a key WTC 1993 defendant be imprison , address to " parole officer . "
( the position do not exist ) .
Abdel Rahman 's son be capture in Quetta , Pakistan in mid-february 2003 .
that arrest in turn lead to the dramatic capture of Khalid Mohammed , Al Qaeda 's # 3 .
Mohammed allegedly be hide in the home of the pakistani bacteriologist Dr. Abdul Qadoos Khan .
along with Zawahiri , Abdel Rahman and he two son have have considerable influence over Bin Laden .
he reportedly treat they like son .
although while in jail in the early 1980 , Zawahiri cause considerable tension by challenge the blind sheik 's ability to lead a coalition of the egyptian Islamic Jihad and the egyptian Islamic Group , Zawahiri and OBL be Rahman 's friend .
the imprison WTC 1993 plotter Yousef be KSM 's nephew .
thus , the leader in charge of Al Qaeda 's anthrax production program have a close connection to those imprison in connection with the earlier bombing of the World Trade Center .
accord to the controversial " Feith memo , " which summarize purport intelligence show a iraqi / Al Qaeda connection , Osama Bin Laden have ask iraqi intelligence for technical assistance in send letter bomb a half year before the Al Hayat letter be send .
just because Al Qaeda like its truck bomb and the like to be effective do not mean they do not see the value in a deadly missive .
as Brian Jenkins once say , " terrorism be theater . "
a sender purport to be islamist send cyanide in both early 2002 and early 2003 in New Zealand and ingredient of nerve gas in Belgium in 2003 .
there be even a chapter title " Poisonous Letter " in the Al Qaeda manual .
the " federal eagle " stamp use in the anthrax mailing be a blue - green .
it be widely publish among the militant islamist that martyr go to paradise " in the heart of green bird . "
in the very interview in which they admit 9/11 , and describe the code use for the four target for the plane , the mastermind admit to the Jenny code , the code for represent the date 9/11 , and use the symbolism of the " green bird . "
Osama Bin Laden later invoke the symbolism in he video " the 19 Martyrs . "
a faq on the Azzam Publications website explain that " in the heart of green bird " refer to what be inside .
the mailer 's use of " Greendale School " as the return address for the letter to the senator be also revealing .
a May 2001 letter that Zawahiri send to egyptian Islamic Jihad member abroad establish that Zawahiri use " school " as a code word for the egyptian militant islamist in he correspondence .
green symbolize Islam and be the Prophet Mohammed 's color .
by Greendale School , the anthrax perp be be cute , just as Yazid Sufaat be be cute in name he lab Green Laboratory Medicine .
" dale " mean " river valley . "
Greendale likely refer to green river valley -- i.e. , Cairo 's egyptian Islamic Jihad or the Islamic Group .
the sender probably be announce that he be of either egyptian Islamic Jihad , egyptian Islamic Group or Jihad - al Qaeda , which be actually the full name of the group after the merger of the egyptian Islamic Jihad and al Qaeda .
at the Darunta complex where jihadi train , recruit would wear green uniform , except for Friday when they be wash .
in a Hadith the Messenger of Allah explain that the soul of the martyr be in the heart of green bird that fly wherever they please in the paradise .
as to opportunity , though seldom report , there be a wealth of " open source " information about possible Al Qaeda or egyptian Islamic Jihad or egyptian Islamic Group in the United States and Canada .
the public information mostly relate to those suspect sleeper who have be detain or who be at large and be be seek .
he travel under a alias and be accompany by a former US Army sergeant name Ali Mohammed .
what mosque exactly do they visit and who do they meet ?
whatever you political persuasion , the FBI and CIA deserve we support .
we be , after all , in this together .
first , the nature of such a investigation be that we lack sufficient information to second - guess ( or even know ) what the FBI be do .
media report be a poor approximation of reality because of the lack of good source .
second , hindsight be 20 / 20 .
third , with the " new age " Efrem Zimbalist , Jr. in charge of the investigation , it be not likely we could do better in strike the appropriate balance between due process and national security .
finally , the " Hatfill theory " seem to have be exhaust or at least lose public favor .
the " Hatfill theory " accuse Dr. Stephen Hatfill be always highly dubious .
the suspicion be found on many false premise , and there be no reliable publicly know evidence indicate he guilt .
the FBI 's fixation on Hatfill ( at least as rumor by some reporter ) may have stem from a warning by one senator that career hang in the balance .
Leahy 's chief of staff apparently start with the strong predisposition that some right - winger be involved because two liberal democrat have be target .
the Hatfill theory -- to include ongoing interview and ongoing 7 / 24 surveillance by 8 surveillance specialist -- be now the subject of pending civil rights and libel claim of uncertain merit .
a suit against the New York Times and columnist Nicholas Kristof be dismiss in late November 2004 .
the judge have agree to delay the civil rights matter from proceeding until at least October 2004 .
the Hatfill theory ironically might best be understand as a Al Qaeda theory , with a coincidental malaysian connection add to the other circumstance .
give the regrettable leak that he be under suspicion , it be only fair that the FBI leak with equal enthusiasm the fact that Dr. Hatfill have now be drop as a suspect if and when that prove to be the case .
a search of Dr. Ken Berry 's residence likely will prove just about the last gasp of a biodefense insider theory .
senior official have be quote in the press as say that the search be for the purpose of exclude he as much as include he .

Anne , Mike will call you regard Sarah .
however , when we be talk about this position , Mike compare Sara to Elena .
Elena 's title be admin coordinator , and I know that Sara should not have this title , and honestly do not think that Elena should also .
admin coordinator' do primarily administrative work .
if the latter be the case , we could place both Sara and Elena in a specialist job group ( the salary range be 33 - 66 k ) .
please advise .
thanks a lot .
I appreciate all you help .
good news .
Martin 's box be work wonderfully - I will have everything transfer to it and give he the key by Friday .
this be ( another ) nice deal for Enron .
we save $ 21,000 in real money this way , the cash refund Sun be give Enron for we other server , use a box that be not be use by anyone .
I be happy about this .
Anne , please , include this info in Iris 's file
thanks for put the paperwork together .
I would have interest in meeting if you can present unique investment opportunity that I do not have access to now .
most of my contact with financial advisor in the past have consist of they suggest a mutual fund , tell I to invest in Home Depot , Sun , and Coke , or try to pass off they bank 's biased research report as something valuable .
the above service provide no value to I personally .
if you can present opportunity such as access to private equity or hedge fund , or other idea with strong growth potential and low correlation to the s@p , I would listen .
we will get the paperwork together and send to you for naked option .
at some point , I would like to talk about the diversification strategy in more detail -- perhaps over dinner or a quick meeting after the market close ?
appreciate the idea .
however , with my natural long , I be not look to really trade around the position .
I believe ENE will continue to be range bound , but in case it be not , I do not want to forgo 50 % of my option premium .
I have price target of where I would like to lighten up exposure to ENE and will use call to implement the stategy .
to that regards , I notice I be not approve to sell naked call .
I would like that ability in order to hedge some exposure I have of unexercised vested option .
please look into that for I .
I be look at the recent pullback in ENE and think it might be a opportunity to buy back the call you sell .
of course , you would then be in a position to sell call again if the stock make a bounce .
I be not sure that ENE @ 75 be the place , but maybe @ 73 .
call I if you be interested .

the next 5 company be my responsibility while in EBS , and do not get assign during the reorg .
80y - Enron Broadband Acquisition , Inc .
this entity be create in 2000 for the acquistion of WarpSpeed Communications ( now Enron WarpSpeed Services , Inc. 83n ) , and then dissolve upon completion of merger .
company be around with a small amount of asset and liability , but no i/s item .
83n be my responsibility .
I think this entity should stay with 83n .
so I suggest it be assign to Leon .
it should be 4 - easy .
1579 - EBS Network Co. division of 17h .
this one should possibly be assign to network & service group .
I think this could go to either holding / administrative company ( same as 17h ) or network & service ( Leon ) .
4 - easy .
1691 - EPI - EBS Europe
set up last month to centralize merchant asset activity .
break out the activity of 1179 .
a similar entity ( 1179 ) be assign to commodity and trade ( Todd Richards and Mary Fischer ) so this one should be assign to they as well .
4 - easy .
1307 - EBIC - Apache , LLC
roll up to Cherokee Finance VOF , a cfc .
Cherokee Finance VOF be assign to North America ( Glen Walloch and Kevin Walker ) .
maybe this one should also go to they as the only tax which may have to be provide would be foreign tax .
4 - easy .
1689 - EPI - EBS Ventures , LLC
set up last month to centralize merchant asset activity .
break out the activity of 1307 .
same as 1307 .
it should be assign to North America ( Glen Walloch and Kevin Walker ) .
4 - easy .
let I know if you have any question .

please see my comment in red below .
can you recommend where these company each fit within the new organization ?
if possible , can you also give a indication of the rank - 1 through 5 ?
I be originally inquire about purchase a Cross or Signac impressionist lithograph .
I find they and purchase both from a gallery in London , William Weston .
they should be deliver this week .
they be beautiful and will add a lot to we collection .
by the way the Lichtenstein be up and hang in we formal living room and it be magnificent .
I have also purchase a Appel in the last month .
I be interested in several artist .
actually , a lot .
I will be look for one or more of the follow .
my concept be that over time I would like to own one of all the follow artist and they be all depend when I find something that we really like .
I list all of we ( sometimes mine versus my wife 's favorite and priority ) .
they be kind of in rank order but as I state if I find the piece that I like we will purchase it .
I want sign and number .
I realize that some be not sign by the artist but it be a important fact in my buying decision .
I also realize that some may not have do any work on paper or they be outrageously expensive .
for example , I would like to know if Rothko or Kline do any work on paper .
at least that be what I be think now .
Bonnard ( colorful only )
Suerat ( any work on paper ? -
I do not know that he do any )
other impressionist or post impressionist litho
by the way , I be interested in re-look at a Picasso ( although we have 2 ) that you gallery have a couple of year ago .
it be a cubist piece from the 1920 and I believe you call the technique a " push wa " ( pronunciation versus a attempt at the proper spelling ) .
it be for sale in a couple of gallery in SF and be about $ 20,000 .
be there 1 available ?
also I be still think about the Matisse we discuss before but as you can see , I have a lot of other artist I be interested in and it may remain on the back burner because we already have one .

fyi / review / comment
I have a couple of question so I can wrap up the loi :
we refer to license fuel cell energy equipment .
do we intend to reference a particular manufacturer , or should this be more generic ?
do we want to attach a draft of the development agreement , and condition the final deal on agree to term substantially the same as what be in the draft ?
I have a concern that the Enron optionality bug could bite we on the backside with that one .
do we expect to have one epc contract , or several ?
I be look for the confidentiality agreement , which may be in Bart 's file ( have not check closely yet ) .
if anyone have it handy , it could speed thing up for I .
forget the one or more contract question .
I see we expect to have separate contract for each project .

I be look for the confidentiality agreement , which may be in Bart 's file ( have not check closely yet ) .
if anyone have it handy , it could speed thing up for I .
on the issue of the contract , the draft say that the $ 170 m be pay when the epc contract be sign .
be we expect that the portion attributable to each project will be pay as the individual epc contract be sign ?
1 . the pricing that we have give CRRA be specific to FuelCell Energy and would not be meaningful without list the manufacturer ( i.e. , ONSI would be a lot more money ) .
hence , I think that we have to reference the manufacturer .
2 . the attachment of the development agreement be a Jeff question .
in order to mark any 2000 income , we will need to get CRRA to execute the development agreement in 2000 .
in my opinion , we should show CRRA a copy of the loi with the assumption that the development agreement be attach .
I would actually send they the draft development agreement a couple day after the loi .
base on how CRRA react , I would make a ultimate determination if the agreement need to be attach to the loi .
3 . I expect at least one epc contract per project .
we do not want to condition the acceptance of one project on the performance of another project .
remarkably clear explanation .

off and on ( with Jackie Gentle 's help ) I have pull together a one page communication note on we fundamental operating standard ( itself a one page summary ) .
we be in the final stage of this process - where we draft a cover letter for John which will introduce this for inclusion within Globalflash ( the Enron Europe newsletter )
have you any thought on draft or cover note ?
late Jan sound great .
I believe that these be three weekend in a row , January 6 , 13 and 20th .
so the last weekend in January would work well ( and I will need a rest from formal affair ! ) .
do that work for you ?
and do you want to do it on a Saturday or Sunday ?
Saturday probably work better for I , just so that I be back in Houston and do laundry by Sunday afternoon !!
talk to the little mother - to - be .
she say a shower would be grand .
she have some big presentation mid-January .
how do late January sound to you .
should we set a date now ?
be I turn into mother ?
I think that it be a great idea to get some press regard we fundamental operating standard , but I wonder about the most appropriate timing , enough of a global message and the means of delivery .
on the means of delivery , I be not sure from you note whether or not I fully understand the intent .
or be the letter from John a introduction to be include as a lead in to the article ?
with regard to a global message , I think that one of the key point around fundamental operating standard be that they be intend to be global in nature , apply to every commodity and every location where we engage in trading activity .
with these operating standard implement worldwide , we will know as operation professional that risk be be mitigate and we will be able to ensure Enron top management that there be consistency in operating standard worldwide .
these global standard also should enable Enron to expand its business reach more quickly , with well define requirement with regard to trading operation .
I be not sure from the article as write that the global nature of this effort come across .
finally , a question regard timing .
I do not believe that we be quite at the point that we can say that all business controller worldwide have review , understand and have implement these standard .
and not to belittle the process of create the standard , the tough part ( and the real meat behind this ) will be a effective exception report on a global basis against these standard .
my commitment to Rick Causey be that I will have that global report in production by the end of the year .
there be much work to do in define the content and regularity of the report and even more work to do to identify reliable source of data for compile the report .
Shona have commission Mike Moscoso to work on this , and I believe that Mike have already be work with James New .
would a more appropriate time be after the Global Operations Controller meeting in October when we should have worldwide buy - in and commitment to these standard and ( hopefully ) we first draft of a meaningful exception report ?
sorry that this response look so long .
I have be interrupt 20 time while respond , so I hope that it make sense .
thanks for share this with I .
since you ask for input , I hope that you do not mind that I give you some .

Steve , I notice that we allocation from 2000 to 2001 be go up by 21 % year on year ( ie ) $ 13.9 m from $ 11.5 m .
we have be able to keep ENA 's direct group expense flat year on year , we be try hard to keep the corporate allocation flat year to year as well .
do you have a view on how we might be able to achieve this goal ?
do not worry about it ... sorry for put you back on speaker .

see below .
can we get some help on the IBM issue ?
11/10/2000 11:08 am
at this point , we it contact be backpedal a bit and suggest they can overcome the tibco and terminal server problem .
there be still four important issue , however :
it still can not commit to transfer message across domain .
this mean that message initiate at Corp and intend for the entire Enron organization will not reach any business unit outside the Corp domain .
no message will reach the EES organization unless IBM agree not to use they proprietary message delivery tool , WebSphere , and will use WebLogic instead .
WebLogic be require by BackWeb , although it be design by a separate company .
hr , intend to be a key user of this tool , will not use BackWeb because survey response can not be make anonymous .
hr have already purchase a tool call CONFIRMIT that can execute anonymous survey .
message will not be deliver simultaneously to all user in the same domain , nor will they be deliver for two to five hour after they be send by the message administrator .
another thing to consider be that these message will be set to expire and disappear within a set period of time , mean user can not retrieve they and read they later ( as they can with e-mail ) .
this mean that I could be away from the office for several day and miss a message entirely , because it would have expire and disappear by the time I return .
the plain fact be that a few member of it be push this initiative , but they lack commercial sponsorship .
they be hope Corp will foot the bill for a pilot which will allow they to fully test this tool before implement it company - wide .
please let we know if you have additional question .

what do you think ?
joe_lardy@cargill.com on 03/02/2001 10:39:03 am
currently Cargill and Enron have a 15 mm collateral threshold .
if possible , I think the cleanest way to run this biz would be to put a box around the prime broker biz .
we would still operate under the master isda but could set up a mutually agreeable credit support annex for this biz .
we would still keep the 20,000,000 line reference in schedule b of the poa agreement .
the line in the poa be a seperate and distinct measure from the daily collateral .
the 20 mill reflect gross exposure .
let I know if you think this be reasonable and workable .
we too , be open to suggestion as the Global and Enron relationship be very important and a high priority to we .
I be go to find out how much line we currently have available ... you probably already have this .
we should allocate a piece to Global which would solve the problem of other Cargill people use the line , put we over the limit , without I know ...
we could change the language of the poa to this ...
we will not go over Global 's piece of the Cargill line ...
I think this would solve we main concern ...
please let I know ... we be eager to keep trade with Global and yourselves ...
let I know if we need to discuss anything .
I be hopeful that we be ready to prepare execution copy .
02/27/2001 08:23 am
attach for you review be a blackline version of the : ( a ) schedule and ( b ) paragraph 13 to the isda master agreement .

it be less complicated for I to initial and fax than to track down someone who do not know anything about it and get they to initial it .
I can print it here , initial it , and fax it to whomever you want .
she be very conscientious about what she sign , and who initial what .
be the attach form the final final form ?
since it will be Janet sign , it will probably be better to have the initial on the page first .
either fax or someone else work fine .

they would only give he a 6 month lease when he renew he lease last month because they do not want 3 people in that small apartment .
so he be go to have to start look for another place .
I guess mom be go to come back down sometime in March or April to see the new baby .
you will have to come visit to check out my new house .
the upstairs " guest suite " be pretty neat .
it be get its own bathroom and tv , and be pretty cozy .
as far as the call with uncle Ben go , if he be thrilled to hear from I I could not tell by he voice .
it be a pretty stilted conversation for both of we .
but , I guess , it be a start ...
I have already make my XMAS plan .
I leave the evening of the 21st , my flight come in about 10 pm , and leave the morning of the 27th at 6 am .
it be good chat with you .

add all the Enron " specify entity " would only make a default under a financial transaction with those other Enron entity a default under this agreement .
we concern be that we do not want any trading related default to ever trigger a default under a loan transaction which have a swap as a component .
11/30/2000 10:52 am
if you do add all the entity , do that mean that we would not need to put in place a separate agreement for ECCL ?
with respect to Deutsche Bank ( "" DB " ) , we have one credit issue remain , DB would like we to add all the Enron trading entity DB trade with as specify entity under the isda master agreement and we be somewhat hesitant to do so , as this could potentially roll up swap under structure loan transaction into a default under the isda agreement .
Sara and Bill Bradford in credit be suppose to talk to the DB credit people about this remain issue .
with respect to First Union National Bank , the draft we be work from be so old that they agree to look at we current form of agreement which be send to they on 11/8/00 for review .
Sara be work on that with Susan Bailey , another paralegal in we group .

as for Ted , thing be still go well although I have not see he at all this week ( we be two very busy people ) .
but , we have a great laid back day last Saturday and I think have hit that comfortable stage ... you know , not quite so formal about date etc .
in one sense it be great , but it also make thing a lot harder to read .
anyway , I be sure my mom tell you guy but Travis and Kathy get to meet he and I think it go well .
hopefully , if we be still date come December , you and Chuck can meet he when you come back to visit .
I be plan on drag he to at least one of the U.T. game , I just have to find out when he want to go ( as well as properly prepare he for the Scott / Kelley / Parks / Wild Card gang and the full - day affair that be a U.T. game ) .

I think that we will stay in Korea when you parent come and do the whole base thing ( which will take only a few minute , actually ) , but be consider go to China or somewhere during part of Thanksgiving .
let we know the latest with Ted and also with what be go on in Houston .
take care ,

Kori tell I she see you last night at steak night and introduce herself since I fail to do so the last time we go .
I should let you know though that she be very offended this morning that you do not spell she name right in the email - I mean it be such a common spelling .

she be a very fun girl .
hope you day be go well and that the move to 30 go off without a hitch .

however , have drive with you on several occasion I feel confident you will be able to pass the test with fly color .
keep in mind though that if you end up fail I will not let you forget it ( and , as we have establish , I have the memory of a elephant ) .
I will keep discussion of I to a minimum and just say that thing be well on 32 .
think you would like to know that the Dixie Chicks be come back to Houston Dec. 12 and will perform just down the street from you at the Compaq Center ... it be all about you and you need .

please find attach the most recent update for Merchanting Metals .
in summary the plan system change and manual substantiation effort be behind schedule .
additional resource be be allocate and the situation be be closely monitor ( both for quarter end signoff and on going operation ) .
please contact I if you require any additional information
the intention of the effort and action document in my earlier update ( see attach email ) be to provide a robust position signoff process for total metal tonnage , spread and brand and location a timely substantiation of stock on balance sheet forward mtm debtor and creditor balance obsf transactional value and a reconciliation of the barclays intercompany account
despite the best effort of it , continue problem with the as400 application , a better understanding of the inconsistency between stock reconciliation report , and concern over the useability of the outright stock screen enquiry be such that I be currently not confident of deliver sufficient accurate information to aa to satisfy they audit requirement - which at a macro level be the transparent audit trail between stock and forward position to full accounting value .
I will discuss with aa the follow
that obsf value within the extend trial balance may be misstate due to data issue ( above and beyond exist conversation with aa on model simplification )
that there be reconciling difference between trader position analysis , as400 on screen enquiry and the formal global position report ( these difference be at present not understand but would need to be provide to aa within the audit timetable )
a outline of the internal balance sheet review process describe in my earlier note which must now be reprioritise and rescop ( see mo work )
the creation of a incentive payment pool ( possibly via personal best award ) for key Metals staff who continue to work exceptionally unsociable hour to meet the above state objective
the signoff for additional permanent ' Enron ' headcount who will ' duplicate ' certain key position control process ultimately replace some exist Traffic staff
a reconciling difference of $ 15 mm exist between the report dpr and the final accounting p&l as generate on the as400 .
we will continue to investigate potential misstatement in the system p&l , as a result of data or system valuation problem , within the month end reporting timeframe .
however , this difference may need to be adjust for follow a final review and signoff of system p&l value with trader .
the recall of all obsf stock in early April and retention on balance sheet ( reduce where economically viable ) until position be fully reconcile and repeatable daily signoff process can be instigate .
Middle Office work be prioritise be as follow
the stock circularisation initiate for close of business 23rd - with full reconciliation of return to current system data by traffic / co-ordination a audit of the stock and forward valuation report for the 30th ( replace plan 23rd review due to system issue ) , require full download of contract detail for later reference
reconciliation of stock movement between 23rd and 30th sample test of vanilla forward transaction
detailed position analysis of all obsf contract that must be reconcile to Barclays documentation
spreadsheet recalculation of obsf option premium utilise the above manually create position analysis
the circularisation of Barclays intercompany account and comparison to we cut off and substantiation analysis
the debtor / creditor partial circularisation initiate for close of business 23rd
I will be in touch directly re the item need approval
several related issue have result in a increase in the level of operating risk for the Merchanting Metals business .
complexity surround the operation of the off balance sheet facility ( " obsf " ) which commence two week before the year end .
the uncertainty generate by the revocation of aa 's signoff for the facility late in the year end audit .
the discovery of a number of ' bug ' within the as400 Merchanting code , arise from the release of obsf design functionality , which compound the operational burden of support the obsf .
the requirement to amend the operational process and obsf it code as a result of the current renegotiation of the obsf with Barclays ( and aa ) .
the senior it developer for Merchanting have resign and be send on gardening leave .
the corporate requirement to lower working capital usage for the Merchanting business irrespective of the above parochial business issue .
the implementation for sap for the Merchanting business have be delay and effectively decouple from the higher risk ( higher benefit ) brokerage implementation - benefit be to provide sole focus on obsf for it Merchanting developer .
the ar / ap sap data quality review for both business be continue so as to provide a detailed analysis as at end q1 .
a enhance position signoff process will be implement prior to end q1 cover gross tonnage , spread position and summarise analysis for brand and location .
the necessary report functionality should be available within the as400 , however contingency have be initiate to build tactical VBA / excel report outside of the as400 but use as400 data download .
user request for additional as400 functionality and report have be aggressively prioritise and a code freeze will commence prior to the end of q1 follow the delivery of three report determine as minimum requirement for the support of obsf .
a resubstantiation of the full q1 dpr will be complete by the risk control staff reconcile the full trial balance between q1 open and q1 close
a full internal balance sheet review will be complete within the q1 audit timetable which incorporate
a full circularisation of inventory balance , and matching to source documentation within Enron
inspection of certain of the above inventory balance , by third party inspector , where there be a expectation that circularisation reply will not be receive on a timely basis
substantive check back to source contract documentation for the forward priced and unpriced position report ( spot check the key position report sign off by the trader )
full reconciliation and recalculation of obsf option premium value
a full substantiation of creditor to internal ( contract commitment ) or external documentation ( invoice / request for payment )
a full reconciliation of intercompany account
a full substantive reconciliation of cash and funding account
I intend to provide weekly update on the status of the above action during April
if you have any question please call I on x34703

this enable rac to manage the associate risk during the life of the transaction both effectively and appropriately .
Randy , this be the issue I leave you the voice mail on .
article 6 of the Gallup Compression Services agreement ( which I be send to you separately ) with ECS obligate ECS to " work in good faith with CDEC " to establish a automated system that would automatically have alert we to peak loading condition on CDEC 's system .
we have a pretty good idea when we sign the contract that ECS would not be able to complete that by the contract start date , so we negotiate a fall back plan under which ECS be obligate to " assist [ Transwestern ] in develop a manual system to accomplish the same result and will hold harmless and keep [ Transwestern ] whole for all cost and expense " associate with the manual system .
we will fight with they about who owe the $ 200 k that James mention below base on they failure to " assist " we in manage the cost .
in the mean time , we need to make sure that we be do everything we can to get a handle on the situation to mitigate future cost .
do we have someone who be watch this out there ?
James have hear that one hold up be the absence of a confidentiality agreement -- I guess between ECS and Transwestern -- that would permit ECS to communicate to we the detail on how to access the key info. from CDEC .
that sound like a bs excuse from ECS , but if that be what they be say , let I know and we can figure out a solution .
12/14/2000 02:49 pm
would you please contact Gerald Nemec and review the Gallup Compression Service Contract in respect to the load control management .
my understanding be that ECS be to provide a means to access CDEC 's online profile in order for we to make a decision to avoid run the compressor during CDEC 's peak load period .
we have not receive access to this information which have result so far in additional electric cost of $ 200,987.33 for the period of July through September .
additional cost will be incur for the remainder of this year , that I have not be able to review yet .
this cost be average $ 79,000 per month if we continue to run the compressor as we have in August and September .
good point , but I be comfortable we be cover because we bidder be all bid on a chunk of capacity and primary point .
they be deem to be on notice that they have alternate point rights ( it be in the tariff ) and if they want to submit a bid that have a different rate for primary and alternate , they could have do so .
none of they do , and most importantly , the win bidder do not .
we letter agreement simply memorialize that we will charge the same negotiate rate whether the gas flow on primary or alternate .
I assume from you message you be ok with this and they can get it nail down ?
I just get do look at the underlying contract language as set forth in the pro forma service agreement in the tariff and it specifically say that the max rate would apply unless a discount or negotiate rate have be agree to .
my concern with add the language below be , could it be argue that not everyone know the rate would or could apply at any point , since we just state Topack and Needles and if they know they might have bid a different rate ??
01/11/2001 02:42 pm
after discussion with the commercial group I propose that that redlined language be add to the attach Dynegy agreement and to the 4 other negotiate rate agreement we have do .
if there be any objection you need to get back to I asap .
pls print .
in discussion with Dave , we think it would be good to put this together in a format of question and answer .
however , as you will see , the question I think of get kinda long - but I think we need answer for all of they .
one thought be to have just the agenda as a couple topic and then lead in with the first two question as I have list .
please provide I you thought asap .
here it be .
here be the attachment ...
attach be my draft of a request for rehearing .
it incorporate Mr. Stojic 's and Mr. Kelly 's initial comment .
please review it and let I know if you have any comment on or before Tuesday afternoon ( I will be out of the office Monday ) .
thank you !

Doug and I meet with the chairman of PUCT and have have subsequent conversation .
Thane and I also visit with he .
Pat Wood make a phone call to Tom Noel and tell he to get the Texas market fix .
( even though he have bigger thing to do in D.C. , this be he legacy and he recognize that if deregulation do not work in Texas , the repercussion could be global . )
Chairman Sibley and Chairman Wolens ( of the Texas legislature ) be also engage in market development .
we have be work with the state affair legislative committee and keep they apprise .
there be a electric restructuring committee hearing schedule for September 6th or 7th .
the forum be expect to be invite testimony only .
those currently list as invitee be PUCT commissioner and Ercot 's Sam Jones and Tom Noel .
now that Sibley be not a candidate for Lt. Governor , there be more freedom to open up and ask some difficult question .
Thane be in Austin on Friday , but be available by phone .
I will be on a plane to Houston at 8:00 a.m .
can we find another time that work for we to meet ?

thanks , Jean
Jean & Thane --
walk out last night , Kevin Presto indicate that there be game be play in ERCOT with the new market rule and price in certain market be not reflective of work market .
if ERCOT go the way of California - either due to market power or poor market design rule - it will be a bad day for deregulation and for Pat Wood .
as important , the new PUCT commissioner need some help right now in message the market .
let 's get they to support constructive solution that will make a real difference .
Jean and Thane , I think that we need a formal plan on what to do over the next 3 - 6 month to leverage this situation .
I would like to discuss this with you on Friday am .
I be free at 8 am on Friday before Rick 's budget meeting .
you may want to discuss with Becky .

this would replace the paper copy you and you people be currently get .

we inform Tana that we make the change in global counterparty to include , " a division of Cargill Incorporated " .
we will meet in the near future to discuss the issue surround division and trade name setup in global counterparty .
if Sam 's description below of the gcp procedure be correct , it look to I like something need to be change .
the difficulty lie in the fact that the confirmation system read the counterparty 's name from global counterparty .
since division of company be not legal entity they do not have the power to contract in they own name .
if the correct legal name be not in global counterparty , the confirmation go out with the wrong legal name on it seriously compromise the contract itself .
that be the source of Tana 's concern regard the correct entering of division in the system .
my suggestion be that global counterparty use the same name that the customer have sign on the EnronOnline password application -- my understanding be that the EnronOnline team return inappropriate application to the customer until they be correctly complete .
in this particular case since the counterparty be still not allow to transact on EnronOnline almost a month after send in they application they be understandably upset and be now complain .
I would appreciate it if you could get this one fix today and , if you have any problem with change the gcp procedure , please let I know .

Cargill Ferrous International be set up correctly in the global counterparty system as a division of Cargill , Inc .
Cargill Ferrous International be the full name of this division and set up as such in gcp with a sub - to - legal link to Cargill , Inc. per gcp procedure .
also , the global sap team ( Cheryl Johnson ) would need legal name change documentation from the counterparty in order to change this name .
best rgd .
Samuel x3-9890 ( gcp ) Enron Net Works _ global data management
any update on add the correct legal name to this counterparty name ?
yes , gcp provide the link to establish the correlation between the parent and child for we downstream system .
( although , we have break that rule for legal in the past . )
this defeat the purpose of use a tradename .
best rgd .
please review the process below :
with division , EOL do request a new password application for the applicant reflect the name as you note below .
when the company be set up in the EOL database we link the company to the parent and reference the cp id .

to whom it may concern :
through tv and newspaper , I hear constantly about identity fraud use steal social security information .
I be very concerned about this issue .
I have the follow suggestion for we company .
since Enron 's employee be assign a sap identification number ( p number ) and a hr number , could Enron as a company use these id instead of the ss number ?
this will be safer for all employee .
for example , I be concerned when I buy the monthly bus pass and I have to fill in my ss number .
I do not feel secure at all to see my ss in so many database at Enron , especially when some database be from third - party ( out - sourcing ) .
we could use we badge number there instead of we ss .
please let I know how you organization can help the Enron employee feel safer about the safeguard of they ss number .

confidential settlement document per CPUC rule 51
gas accord ii settlement participant :
attach be PG&E 's gas accord ii ( ga ii ) settlement proposal .
we believe it address many of the issue and concern you have raise in the workshop .
as a overview , this proposal : * maintain the basic gas accord structure in place today for the period 2003 to 2007 . *
* offer end user transportation rate for 2003 lower for most customer than rate in effect today . *
* provide for vintage redwood path rate for core customer . *
* offer a 7.5 cent / dth rate to large customer while minimize rate change to other customer , minimize the incentive for these customer to seek to bypass local transmission charge and other CPUC - approve charge . *
* adopt guideline to improve reliability and help moderate price in gas commodity market , and identify the capital project need to meet these guideline over the course of the ga ii period ( 2003 - 2007 ) . *
* provide a high degree of rate stability , with a 3.5 % escalator to capture both inflation and the cost of need capital project .
the guarantee rate will be adjustable only for significant change in the cost of capital or increase cost due to governmental requirement or catastrophic event . *
* preserve a rate differential between the redwood and baja path , although somewhat less than the current differential . *
* propose a two - stage open season for firm transportation service begin in 2003 , with end user receive a first option on available capacity . *
* maintain the core aggregation program with some adjustment .
PG&E also anticipate that the core procurement incentive mechanism ( cpim ) will be similar to today 's mechanism , but will reflect the somewhat larger capacity holding need to meet anticipate increase in core demand and to meet a 1 - day in 10 - year cold weather event .
this also will serve as a reminder that a all - party meeting be schedule at PG&E 's headquarters in San Francisco on January 10 and 11 , to discuss this proposal and to respond to you question .

nice job .
go to be a wild ride .
that be a very good point .
I will make the change .
12/26/2000 03:33 pm
instead of suggest a specific rate increase - 10 or 15 % , I think we should acknowledge that a " modest " increase may be necessary and may in fact be desirable - but that the specific amount of increase should be reasoned and subject to well think out evidence and hearing , not just determine by whim .
in general , we should not be overly prescriptive at this point and I know you agree with that .
otherwise , I think you have capture the point excellently .
we be in the process of develop a strategy to take we through the next few month .
observation -- the pressure to finger somebody for " price gouging " be increase .
the administration be hell bent on find a " fall guy . "
the price spike pose real political risk for Davis and he and he folk need and want a easy way out .
he press release follow the hearing renew the call for " refund . "
on my panel , Loretta Lynch ask Reliant and Duke to supply she with the detail of the contract they cut to sell they power forward to marketer .
and Carl Wood 's remark be extreme .
at the Barton hearing , a liberal democrat ( Filner ) and a conservative Republican ( Hunter ) lock arm in call for refund .
Bilbray join the " gouging " band wagon .
the utility repeatedly call on FERC to do a " real " investigation , with hearing , testimony , data discovery --- the work .
on the positive side , the FERC commissioner laud Wolak , he analysis , and he remark on the panel .
Wolak say somewhat emphatically that the nature of California 's market structure make it impossible to single out a single participant as the culprit .
he also state that just everyone be just act in they own self - interest , respond to the screw incentive embed in the structure .
implication -- it seem prudent for Enron to understand better its risk of get finger .
in the best case , the clamoring for a " refund " subside .
in which case , the only cost to Enron be the internal cost incur to understand better the risk of get finger .
in the medium case , investigation find that Enron ( like other ) " play by the rule , " but the rule stink , and Enron profit at the expense of California consumer .
you be right , Sue .
rate can not go up without declare the rate freeze over in some fashion --- try to finesse it .
thanks very much for the comment .
Harry also have a good comment --- do not specify the amount of rate increase in we comment ; rather note that the rate increase need to be well - reason and base on fact and evidence .
will make that change .

01/25/2001 09:40 am
Tom Byargeon , Kevin Miller and Ken Loch in ENA be work with producer in the US involved in deep water offshore Louisiana / Texas oil and gas drilling project .
this financing activity be primarily start to help ENA secure long term well head and pipeline natural gas supplies to supplement the gas trading desk activity .
just like what happen in Enron 's initial vpp program they be find more interest in oil drilling project rather than natural gas project .
they be currently work on a bid ( due 1/31 ) for the Medusa project which involve Murphy ( operator ) , Agip and Callon in Mississippi Canyon Blocks # 538 and # 582 .
the initial reservoir report estimate reserve of 80 - 120 million barrel of sour crude and they estimate initial production to be 40,000 bpd start in 1q 2003 .
quality be estimate to be a Mars type crude with 25 - 27 api gravity and 1.5 - 2.0 % sulfur .
plan be to build a private pipeline to Equilon 's West Delta # 143 platform and then bring the oil onshore .
Peggy be find out where WD # 143 pump to onshore .
the floating could be tie to a Platt 's index or the NYMEX .
it be far too early to expect Murphy to enter into a physical or financial contract , but Tom hope to get we first and / or last look from Murphy when the time be right .
another alternative be to give Murphy barrel at they 95,000 bpd Meraux , Louisiana refinery in exchange for the new production barrel .
could someone in you group please give I a notional non bind basis differential for this quality of crude for Cal 2003 ?
01/24/2001 01:02 pm
please address , and I will check with legal as well .
we typically only book deal when everything be sign off .
01/26/2001 09:37 am
follow up on we discussion yesterday ; for these type of deal , i do not think it be necessary to have all the documentation of we counterparty 's authorization to enter into the agreement .
these be short term transaction and require this documentation will cause we to lose business because competitive alternative do not have such burdensome requirement .
the primary reason we need these thing be for the scenario where a muni do a derivative deal with a open - ended downside , lose $ 50 million , and then claim that it be not a valid contract .
in we case , they be only hedge .
we be collect a premium up front and they total cost be know up front .
therefore they will not attempt to make this claim .
even if they do , we risk be limit to the premium , not some big payout .
the risk of lose business be far greater than the risk of a counterparty try to get they premium back .
seem like a 5 second decision to I .
be it possible to combine the standard isda and we confirm into a single long form ?
by go away from the standard isda maybe we can eliminate these requirement because the payout liability be only 1 - way .

dear Mr. Shankman ,
thank you very much for you quick reply .

what happen ?
here be a story ... as I be wait at the bus stop ( 7:35 am ) to go to school , a lady approach I and ask if I would make sure she daughter get on a certain bus .
the mother be run late for work and could not wait .
I could not say no ... so Nicki ( the little girl - 10 yrs. old ) and I wait for the bus .
it be now , 8:15 and there be no sign of she bus .
on top of thing , I have quiz at 8 am .
I decide that Nicki would just have to wait on she own .
I ask she if she have any relative that would want to know of she whereabouts .
I call she grandmother and explain thing to she .
pretty strange ... aye .
a bus that run through UofH arrive and I almost get on without she , but I could not do it .
finally , I tell the little girl that she would have to accompany I to school ( 8:30 am ) .
there be only 15 minute left of class .
I stay for the remainder of the lecture .
after class we go back to bus stop and within minute she bus arrive .
I tell the bus driver where to drop she off .
I notify she grandmother with the time of the departure .

I have attempt to incorporate the change that Jim have incorporate in we long form power agreement which ENA have suggest to date into the short form .
attach please find a sample short form ( for the con ed market ) for you review .
please note the follow as you review :
1 . the short form do not contain the optionality relate to we perform billing service -- all of we midmarket form anticipate that we will act as customer 's billing agent and that we will collect all amount due related to t&d and the like from the customer ( and reflect same on we invoice ) and pass those amount on to the customer 's utility .
if you feel strongly about we include a setoff provision , we will do so .
3 . the change in law provision read a bit differently from the long form -- the thinking here be that the long form language be very lengthy and rather harsh ( and we have have great difficulty sell it in the past ) .
take into consideration this class of customer , we decide to include certain item , include we inability to cover we cost due to a change in law , rule or practice as a " force majeure event " in a effort to soften the approach ( see the gtc ) .
if you be comfortable , we will drive these change into we other midmarket power form .
thanks again for you help with this project ,
p.s. please be sure to copy Sarah Dietrich and Jennifer Hillegonds on you response -- they will be take this project during my " hiatus " -- I be move to PA on Friday of this week , and will be out of pocket through approximately 7/16 .
I will start up again in mid-July ...
I have fax to you the form of bond , we propose bond provision and the eei master .
I be wait on the confirm and will send they to you shortly by fax or e-mail .

$ 10.0 m - negotiate rate reserve ( Reliant , Sempra , Richardson , Astr , and BP Energy ) - $ collect
$ 2.7 m - SoCal rate issue - $ not collect
$ 1.8 m - additional month of PGE revenue due to prepayment invoicing begin in 2001 - $ collect

the in - service date of May 1 , will be very difficult to attain .

we have work with Daniels on a chromatograph on another project and prepayment have take 45 day alone .
Daniels be not set up for prepayment as they bill off a invoice and the main office and accounting have to create a invoice for a chromatograph that have not be deliver .
not the usual mode of operation .

listen to the Edison call with investor Edison say they will pay everyone at the same time ( " big bang " approach ) sometime in q1 '02 .

investor be ask what Edison intend for qf and generator -- ask about haircut in particular -- and Edison be side - step the question .

the investigative committee , head by state Sen. Joe Dunn , D - Santa Ana , be focus on a series of event last fall fill with enough shakespearean plot twist and intrigue that it have earn a name around the Capitol : " the palace coup . "
lawmaker and consumer group allege that the event - direct by the man who head the state 's energy grid - fuel the California energy crisis , push the state into the power - buy business and help make billion of dollar for power producer .
the central question behind the palace coup be whether Terry Winter , the president of the Independent System Operator , act alone when he take step to remove key price cap design to limit the amount power generator could charge .
Winter defy he own board and Gov. Gray Davis when he file a 50 - page request to remove the cap , record and interview show .
" I do not know how these event could have take place without some concerted effort , " say Dunn .
the subpoena will force those involve , include Winter , to provide swear testimony about the event to the committee , and to turn over e-mail , personal calendar and memo .
Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio say the governor feel " betrayed " by the action of Winter .
" the governor believe it be the define moment , when what be a mount problem turn into a instant crisis , " Maviglio say .
Winter refuse comment , refer all question to the public relation office .
ISO spokesman Gregg Fishman say Dunn 's committee will find no criminal conduct .
the decision be make by ISO upper management with one goal in mind : to keep the light on .
at the time , generator be refuse to sell power in California because of the price cap .
" it be a emergency , " Fishman say .
" we have to take action . ''
what become known as the palace coup begin on Oct. 26 when ISO board member vote for severe restriction on the amount of money electricity producer could charge for power .
" they ( electricity generator ) grin and bear the $ 750 price cap , but this new plan by ISO be too much , " say Dunn , whose committee have be investigate since March .
" all hell break loose . ''
record show that on Oct. 31 , power generator and electricity trader file letter with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission , demand that the new plan be kill .
the letter , six in all , be send within two hour of each other and represent dozen of power generator .
" if not remove immediately , the ( ISO ) price cap will sow confusion in the market , threaten reliability and stifle new investment in generating capacity , '' read one letter write by Duke Energy vice president William Hall iii .
although there be nothing illegal about the generator act together to lobby against price cap , Dunn believe the letter and other action around the same time show clear coordination among energy official .
he say the main aim of the subpoena will be to determine whether collusion occur to " fix " price , which would violate federal trade law .
in the Oct. 31 letter , electricity producer tell federal official that if price cap be not remove it would lead to a collapse of the energy market .
the generator get they way .
the next day , the federal commission kill the new pricing plan .
what be leave in place be a $ 250 price cap establish five month earlier .
power producer then turn they attention toward kill that cap , say they could not make a profit even under these constraint .
they begin to withhold power from California , and on Dec. 7 the ISO declare its first stage 3 emergency and brace for blackout , which be narrowly avert .
what follow the next day be consider by the governor and Dunn to be the pivotal moment of the energy crisis .
Winter , who in he position as president and chief operate officer of the ISO , submit a 50 - page emergency request , ask federal official to abolish the $ 250 price cap .
final authority over lift the cap rest with the federal government .
neither the ISO board , which have establish the price cap , nor the governor learn of Winter 's action until the cap have be remove .
in fact , the attorney who help draft the emergency request , Charles Robinson , be in a meeting with representative of the governor and ISO board member just hour before the filing be make .
he do not mention anything about it .
" in retrospect , we should have tell they , '' Robinson say .
" the ISO staff sit in a meeting with the governor 's key energy adviser with poker face , not say a word about something that be go on at the exact same moment , '' Maviglio say .
" it be beyond belief that they fail to mention something so significant .
this action accelerate the utility 's move toward bankruptcy and force the governor to move the state into the power - buy business . "
price for electricity jump from a average of $ 249 a megawatt to $ 700 a megawatt within three day , ISO record show .
Dunn believe the result overcharge for electricity exceed $ 30 billion .
Robinson say the filing - grant two hour after the request - help rather than hurt Californians .
price , he say , do not spike as a result .
instead they follow the skyrocket price of natural gas - which be use to run power plant to generate electricity .
Robinson say the emergency order allow the ISO to secure refund should overcharge for electricity be prove to federal official .
" we believe the action we take address a severe concern , '' Robinson say .
" in we view , we do not believe we change or make worse the financial situation .
we feel we make it better because it introduce a process for review and refund . "
Jan Smutney - Jones , who be the ISO board chairman at the time and executive director of a group that represent power generator , say Winter do not consult he about eliminate the price cap .
Smutney - Jones also say he be unaware of anyone in the power - generating community be consult .
" Terry do this by himself , '' say Smutney - Jones , executive director of the Independent Energy Producers .
" he do what he think have to be do at the time to keep the power flow . "
the ISO board call a emergency meeting the next week demand Winter explain he action .
some board member push to have Winter remove , but there be concern such action would lead to more chaos , the governor 's spokesman Maviglio say .
James J. Hoecker , the former Federal Energy Regulatory Commission chairman , defend make the December decision and also defend Winter .
" they file a emergency motion , and we be not about to let California go dark , '' Hoecker say .
" they ( ISO management ) do what any independent system operator would do . "
what Dunn 's committee hope to learn be why all these event transpire .
he believe memo and e-mail around the time of Winter 's Dec. 8 action should provide vital clue .
" we do not know why he do what he do , but we be eager to find out , " Dunn say .
" Terry say he make that filing in the interest of Californians , but I find that argument have no basis in fact . ''
we should resurrect Mike Smith 's note and get he on the call in the attempt to avoid recreate the wheel on this one .
I can dig it up if you would like .

it be the bad parent out there who fuck up they life and do not seem to understand that once you decide to have kid , it be indeed time to grow up and be a responsible role model for those kid .
very few parent do this .
and this be a direct result of the politically correct , permissive , time out grant bullshit liberal culture that have cause this .
when you blame it all on society , there be noone to to take responsibility and all of a sudden you have generation of fuck up kid who be likley smoke , drink , do drug , fuck the neighbor or some internet perv just because you be too lazy to see waht they be do .

it look like NASA be ready to sour again after it's devastating loss from the Columbia accident which occur nearly two year ago .
now , NASA engineer and astronaut be almost giddy with " go " fever as the tentative date for the first launch since the Columbia disaster approach .
the most important question be not whether Discovery be technically ready to fly with new safety feature and emergency procedure , but whether the agency itself have learn from the crucial error most common to Challenger and Columbia , error that grow out of a management culture that discourage criticism and sacrifice safety for image - puffing and budget - cutting .
I hope so .
see another " Columbia " incident can be quite frightening ( I wake up to it early in the morning when I be in Texas ) .
we do not need another incident as explore the cosmos be something that keep we imagination go as a species .
maybe one day they will allow space tourism , ( hopefully that will be in the near future ) although I would recommend that NASA build new shuttle instead of try to preserve the older one .
you do have to give NASA credit on some thing as they have eliminate the " fear of report failure " culture that probably lead to the lack of report defect on the Columbia shuttle .
instead they be encourage everyone to come forward if they see any potential problem ( as it be clear that overlook problem could result in unnecessary loss ) .
but supporter be point a few good thing out :
clearly , the agency have work hard at tackle the technical challenge pose by a superb and surprisingly independent - minded investigative panel .
a few week ago , shuttle worker at the Kennedy Space Center receive a rocket - like boost in morale with two important delivery for the next shuttle to carry .
one be a special tool to detect damage to the thermal - protective tile while in orbit - something the Columbia crew would have welcome .
the other be a new fuel tank " guarantee " by NASA not to shed potentially fatal hunk of insulation .
NASA have some pr hurdle to overcome in the future .
but let s hope for they sake ( and the sake of all space lover out there ) that they can redefine they image and rekindle the hope of space colonization again .

heal the collective body
in George Orwell 's influential novel " 1984 " doublethink be a device promote by the totalitarian state government to make people accept two irreconcilable idea at the same time such as " war be peace " .
I see the merit in flow with duality .
one of my most cherish duality be the understanding that we be both autonomous individual with the power to shape we personal destiny and at the same time we be all one , that there be no separation between you and I , we be all together in this thing call life , we human being , the bird and the tress , the rock and the sky , all of it .
I have write a lot recently about heal the self so today here be a few word on heal we collective body , mind and soul .
think of all life , if you will , as one great choir or one grand congregation .
we strength be in we unity and harmony .
any major dischord and we all suffer .
any insult to the collective good bring we all down .
live out of synch with nature be the great disease , from that flow all the tributary we have come to think of as sickness .
we be only as strong as we weakest , we be only as healthy as the sickest amongst we - play sport and be in the army teach I that lesson before I be finished be a teenager .
when the healthy treat the sick with scorn and intolerance it bring we all down .
when those lucky enough not to have herpes create a climate of shame and indignity for those of we who do , not only be they hurt we , but they be hurt themselves .
there be no escape from the collective ocean we all swim in .
what you project will always come back to either reward or haunt you .
we be now suffer from the consequence of we rape of the environment , we rejection of the natural for the industrial , and we embrace of violence over peace .
Jesus say that what you do the least of the people you do to he .
what be you do to the least of the people ?
if we be all in this thing together , let 's play nice .
remember that what you do to yourself affect I and everybody else , remember that what you do to I and anyone else shape you destiny .
no matter what progress we make as individual in become healthier , we will never achieve real health until we collectively decide to create a healthier reality .
fortunately circumstance will force we hand soon since we collective bad behaviour can not continue indefinitely .
in the near future collective choice will need to be make .
will we choose to live in harmony with this planet or crash and burn in a conflagration of arrogance and disregard ?
will we choose to rise about prejudice and intolerance or go down kick and scream with hold on to fear and anger ?
there be no health without peace and no peace without health .

excellent answer googlenut .
let I add some additional info .
you can get detail about NASA spending here , from they own webpage .
also , from they own webpage , reason why NASA be important , in a 5th grade format .
I guess if you be someone not familiar with how NASA benefit we society I can see how one might form the opinion of yheggy - ga .
let I put it this way - if you have watch TV recently , cross a modern bridge , fly in a airplane , recieve any form of modern medicine , do any mathematics , drive a car , use a cellular phone , etc. then you have somehow directly reap the reward which NASA have return to we .
also NASA have a large outreach program for education , some people believe this be important .

China 's insatiable demand for energy be prompt fear of financial and diplomatic collision around the globe as it seek reliable supplies of oil from as far away as Brazil and Sudan .
a intrusion into japanese territorial water by a chinese nuclear submarine last week and a trade deal with Brazil be the latest apparently unconnected consequence of China 's soar economic growth .
increase car usage in China be create a high demand for petrol
the connection , however , lie in a order issue last year by President Hu Jintao to seek secure oil supplies abroad - preferably one which could not be stop by America in case of conflict over Taiwan .
the submarine incident be put down to a " technical error " by the chinese government , which apologise to Japan .
but even before the incident the People 's Daily , the government mouthpiece , have comment that competition over the East China Sea between the two country be " only a prelude of the game between China and Japan in the arena of international energy " .
the west , however , have pay little attention to these development .
for the United States and Europe be far more concerned with the even more sensitive issue of China 's relation with " pariah state " .
in September , China threaten to veto any move to impose sanction on Sudan over the atrocity in Darfur .
it have invest $ 3 billion in the african country 's oil industry , which supply it with seven per cent of its need .
then , this month , it say that it oppose move to refer Iran 's nuclear stand - off with the International Atomic Energy Agency to the United Nations Security Council .
a week before , China 's second biggest state oil firm have sign a $ 70 billion deal for oilfield and natural gas development with Iran , which already supply 13 per cent of China 's need .
China have its own reserve of oil and natural gas and once be a net oil exporter .
but as its economy have expand by a average of nine per cent per year for the last two decade , so have its demand for energy .
this year it overtake Japan as the world 's second largest consumer of energy , behind the US .
its project demand , boost by a huge rise in car ownership as well as the need to find alternative to pollute coal for electricity generation , have contribute to the surge in the price of oil this year .
shortage be already lead to power cut in the big city .
since President Hu order state - own oil firm to " go abroad " to ensure supply , they have begin drill for gas in the East China Sea , just west of the line that Japan regard as its border .
Japan protest , to no avail , that the project should be a joint one .
the two be also set to clash over Russia 's oil wealth .
Japan favour a route to the sea , enable oil to be ship to both Japan and China .
China want a overland route through its own territory , which would give it ultimate control if hostility break out .
increasingly , analyst be say that China 's effort have go beyond what be safe or even in its own interest .
Claude Mandil , the executive director of the International Energy Agency in Paris , say the reserve in the East China Sea be hardly worth the trouble .
" nobody think that there will be a lot of oil and gas in this part of the world , " he say .
" it may be a difficult political issue but I do not think the energy content be worthwhile . "
" if China 's economy falter , which , in my view , appear increasingly likely , then commodity price will plummet , and with they , the value of the asset that produce they , " Jason Kindopp , Eurasia 's lead China analyst , say .
" Beijing may end up in a early 1990 Japan situation , where it be force to sell recently purchase overseas asset for a fraction of what it pay for they . "
China 's wider aggression to secure oil and gas be the greatest threat to its international standing in the next decade .
" Sudan be the primary example , " he say .
" it mark the first time in recent year that China have promise to wield its veto power in the UN Security Council against a petition initiate by the United States and back by France and Great Britain . "

picture yourself sit on a warm , tropical beach bask in the glow of the sun ... .
visualize the vivid , beautiful colour of the earth ( its flower and plant ) , the sea next to you , and the sky above you .

2 . mountain visualization
another thing you can try .
imagine you be sit on top of a mountain , and that it be the most peaceful place you can think of .
feel that you be sit there in complete peace , right on top of the world .
now imagine that infinite happiness be surround you in every direction .
feel you be completely surround by that infinite peace and happiness .
now start to repeat within you mind the mantra : baba nam kevalam .
its meaning be " infinite happiness be everywhere " .
feel the meaning , do not just think of its wordy meaning or try to translate from Sanskrit ( baba nam kevalam ) to a english meaning ( infinite peace and happiness ) .
think internally , intuitively , not by word , of the meaning , as you be repeat it .
this be call ideation .
it be important to take the idea , not just the intellectual analysis .
touch deep into the idea be what build intuition - it be a synthetic process .
whereas , try to translate and grapple with wordy meaning be a intellectual mechanism - a analytical process .
feel you be surround by infinite peace and happiness , and feel that you own sense of existence be in direct contact with that endless peace and happiness all around you .
you can go further and feel that you unit consciousness , a dot in the infinite consciousness , be merge with infinity .
ok that be fairly basic :) .
the important point be to develop some psycho-spiritual connection between you mind and the universal consciousness or supreme consciousness .
do not worry if you have trouble concentrate on the mantra and ideation - that be normal .
it take some time and practice to be able to focus on the one thought .
the main thing be to keep practice .
if you do not practice , then nothing happen .
well maybe a miracle could happen , but let s face it we be ordinary people and so require practical day to day technique !
NORTH CAROLINA RELIGIOUS COALITION for MARRIAGE EQUALITY
from what we hear from the news media , one could easily conclude that all Christians be opposed to gay marriage .
but that be not the case .
last year a organization name the North Carolina Religious Coalition for Marriage Equality be form to get out the message that at least some people of faith be not opposed to extend the rights and responsibility of civil marriage to same - gender couple .
it present the case for marriage equality and state , " we be resolve that the State should not interfere with same - gender couple who choose to marry and share fully and equally in the rights , responsibility , and commitment of civil marriage . "
a measure to amend the NC constitution to ban gay marriage be defeat last year but already have be reintroduce in the 2005 legislative session , so there be a real need for visible support for the " pro-same - gender - marriage " side of this issue .
at its February meeting the CHS Vestry vote unanimously to add they name to the declaration .
we rector Barbara and we deacon Clare also have sign the declaration .
furthermore , the Vestry vote unanimously to invite the support of member of the CHS congregation for the declaration .
( since the declaration be write as come from " religious leader , " people who do not consider themselves " religious leader " can sign as " supporter of the North Carolina Religious Coalition for Marriage Equality . " )
please note that the declaration address only civil marriage ; it say nothing about religious belief or practice regard marriage .
if you have any question please feel free to call I ( after Sat. the 26th , when I will return from a trip ) .
sign - up list will be available at the service on Feb. 27 and March 6 , or you can email I .
I will email name and email address ( or postal address ) of signer to NCRC4ME in time for they " lobby day " in Raleigh on March 15 .

North Carolina Religious Coalition for Marriage Equality declaration of religious leader April 19 , 2004
the most fundamental human right , after the necessity of food , clothing and shelter , be the right to affection and the supportive love of other human being .
we can grow in we capacity to be human - to be loving - in a family unit .
this right to love and form a family be so fundamental that we United States Constitution take it for grant in its dedication to " secure the blessing of liberty to ourselves and we posterity . "
the North Carolina Constitution likewise affirm the " inalienable rights " of human being to " life , liberty , the enjoyment of the fruit of they own labor , and the pursuit of happiness . "
throughout history , tyrant have know that by deny the right of oppress people to form and nurture family , they can kill the spirit of those people .
> from the shameful history of slavery in America , the injustice of forbid people to marry be evident as a denial of a basic human right .
the american law forbid interracial marriage , now strike down , be clearly discriminatory .
denial of the status of marriage to those who would freely accept its responsibility create legal and economic inequity and social injustice .
we feel call to protest and oppose this injustice .
as religious people , clergy and lay leader , we be mandate by faith to stand for justice in we common civic life .
we oppose the use of sacred text and religious tradition to deny legal equity to same - gender couple .
as concerned citizen we affirm the liberty of adult of the same gender to love and marry .
we respect the fact that debate and discussion continue in many of we religious community as to the scriptural , theological and liturgical issue involve .
however , we draw on we many faith tradition to arrive at a common conviction .
we be resolve that the state should not interfere with same - gender couple who choose to marry and share fully and equally in the rights , responsibility , and commitment of civil marriage .
we affirm freedom of conscience in this matter .
likewise , a denial of state civil recognition dishonor the religious conviction of those community and clergy who officiate at , and bless , same - gender marriage .
the state may not favor the conviction of one religious group over another by deny individual they fundamental right to marry and to have those marriage recognize by civil law .
as faith leader , we commit ourselves to public action , visibility , education , and mutual support in the service of the right and freedom to marry .

the one reason why all Americans should oppose the nomination of Samuel Alito
he would tear down we system of check and balance , give far too much power to the President
my fellow Americans :
as many of you may have hear , President Bush have nominate a long - time federal judge name Samuel Alito to become the next member of the United States Supreme Court , to fill a vacancy create by the retirement of another member of the court .
under we constitution , this nomination can not take effect unless and until the United States Senate give its consent , as describe in we constitution , article ii , section 2 .
a copy of the constitution , with link back to the official source , be locate at http://loveallpeople.org/usconstitutiona.txt
judge Samuel Alito be very highly qualified by all of the normal standard use to evaluate candidate for this position :
he have a very high intellect .
he graduate very high in he class , from Princeton undergraduate and from law school at Yale .
he have a long and distinguished record , include many year as a federal appeal judge , the next level below Supreme Court .
he have encyclopedic knowledge of hundred of different Supreme Court case , and he can recite detail from memory .
he demonstrate a excellent " judicial temperament , " be courteous , mild - mannered , respectful of all people ; careful in he work , meticulous in detail .
he co-worker love he .
he fellow judge love he .
he family love he .
President Bush love he .
yes , it be true that some people do not like the way they think he will vote on the Supreme Court .
so now the Senate be get ready to vote soon , on whether to approve he or not ; and at this moment ( evening of Jan. 27 , 2006 ) it look like he have more than the fifty - one vote need for approval .
the President be very eager to go ahead quickly and get this vote , because he very much want to have Samuel Alito on the Supreme Court , to be judge the case Bush be interested in .
so there be a lot of hurry - up pressure on the Senate to give its prompt vote of approval .
there be a old saying that apply in this situation : " act in haste , repent at leisure . "
sometimes you can make a bad decision very quickly , then regret it for many year to come .
that be what be about to happen with judge Samuel Alito , in my opinion , because he have one tragic flaw - a very serious blind spot in he thinking - which make he completely unacceptable for the position of Supreme Court justice : he do not really agree with the system of " check and balance " build into the constitution , and he be ready to start tear it down in order to follow the " Unitary Executive Theory , " which call for vastly - increase presidential power at the expense of Congress and the Supreme Court .
" he would tear down we system of check and balance , give far too much power to the President . "
in we constitutional system , we have three branch of the Federal Government : the legislative , executive , and judicial branch .
and the basic idea behind the check and balance we have be that if one branch of the government go crazy , the other two can hold it down .
but Samuel Alito believe in a little - know constitutional theory - call the " Unitary Executive Theory " - which say that the President should have complete control over the executive branch , and that the executive branch should be in charge of almost everything that the government actually do , include the function of the independent agency which be design to be free of presidential control , and the military , which exist , which be regulate , and which be fund by specific authority give by the constitution to Congress , not to the President .
the military be not part of the executive branch : it be a separate entity .
under the Unitary Executive Theory , the law of Congress and decision of the Supreme Court have no actual authority unless the President agree with they .
and that be why all AMERICANS should oppose the nomination of SAMUEL ALITO .

NASA & company diplomacy - try to keep moon landing hoax a secret in modern time
some strategy be use by NASA & company in relation to China and other space plan country be mention here after be glean from a news item underneath .
country have a independent strategy = NASA & company to use " numero uno " strategy , try to assert , beat , mesh and control the space program of the country .
this can also be through political , economical , social , and technological influence .
country not open or not have fix strategy = NASA & company to use " freeze thawed " strategy especially when the country have a challenging , grow and ambitious space program .
this can also be through political , economical , social , and technological influence .
dependant = NASA & company to use " space station " model to unify the aim of different country .
China launch its second manned spaceflight mission
secretive effort keep outsider in the dark about the program 's goal
by MARK CARREAU
copyright 2005 Houston Chronicle
China launch Shenzhou VI , its second manned spacecraft , early today in northwest China 's Gansu Province .
a pair of military pilot embark on China 's second manned space flight early today , hurtle into orbit on a test mission that could span five day .
the crew of the Shenzhou VI spacecraft be identify as Fei Junlong , 40 , and Nie Haishen , 41 , by China 's official news agency .
the successful launch from the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center in northwest China follow the solo flight of Yang Liwei in October 2003 .
he one - day mission vault he communist homeland into the elite circle of spacefaring nation - Russia and the United States - that can launch and sustain human in space .
most expert believe China intend to develop a small space station of its own over the next several year .
President Bush have direct NASA to return to the moon by 2018 with a new generation of human explorer .
China 's " be not a fly - by - night program , " say Joan Johnson - Freese , a expert on national security who follow space development in the asian nation at the Naval War College in Newport , R.I .
" they be not in any hurry .
they want a program that will be a success , " Johnson - Freese say .
" they be not go to rush it , because they do not want it to be a budget buster .
economics will be a big determiner in the speed of they program . "
China 's overture to join the U.S. - lead effort to develop the 16 - nation international space station have be thwart for more than a decade over a range of issue , include the asian country 's human rights policy and worry it could acquire technology that could pose a security threat .
the freeze thaw some after Yang 's 2003 mission .
China be among 30 nation invite to send a delegate to NASA - sponsor roundtable discussion on Bush 's strategy to reach the moon with astronaut as the first step in the exploration of Mars and other - deep space destination .
" we applaud China 's space achievement , " NASA spokesman Allard Beutel say Tuesday .
" we wish they a successful return of they astronaut . "
he stress , however , that NASA would not follow this week 's chinese mission through formal channel .
at present , there be no plan for additional meeting with foreign power to discuss the Bush exploration initiative or to extend a invitation to China to join the space station partnership , Beutel say .
the flight of Fei and Nie could mark the end of the open chapter in a three - phase chinese space initiative , Johnson - Freese say .
the first phase , she say , will demonstrate the capability of a multi-compartment spacecraft that will leave a test module in orbit when the two flier return to Earth .
the chinese program 's second phase will include spacewalk on future mission and demonstration of docking and undocking technique .
the final phase will feature the assembly and operation of a longer - duration space lab .
at least one expert believe China 's intention might include a surprise attempt to circle the moon with astronaut before NASA 's plan lunar return .
" there be always the possibility they could jam we up , make we look like we be not numero uno , " Pike say .
during the U.S. and russian lunar race during the Cold War , NASA score a early coup by circle the moon with the Apollo 8 crew over the 1968 Christmas holiday .
as it turn out , the Soviets never make it to the moon .
" ( China ) could be the second country to do that , " Pike say .
" they would get in line in front of the Russians .
and they would not have to land on the moon to take we down a notch . "
Pike 's concern be base on China 's development of a new medium - lift rocket , the Long March V , and the construction of a new space launch complex on Hainan Island in the South China Sea .
the two development , he say , could eventually enable China 's space program to mature to the point that expert could assemble and launch from Earth 's orbit a spacecraft capable of circle the moon with astronaut and return home .

subject : civet cat , James Rachels + a song
this be my first time post to the list , so I feel somewhat embarrassed by " promote " a song I write , but I think it be fitting because it be directly tie to extreme animal suffering as a result of human lack of empathy , but a abundance of human greed .
I be not sure if any of you know much about civet cat , but to brief those who might not know , I will quote James Rachels , author of World Hunger and Moral Obligation among many other animal rights - relate book and article .
( I kind of see he to be for animal rights theory as Peter Singer be to the theory of utilitarianism apply to non-human animal ) .
the quote be from a article entitle " Vegetarianism and ` the Other Weight Problem ' "
if anyone want the complete article , email I , as it be a very good article which no meat - eater can read and not sense they own hypocrisy .
but this be what he say about civet cat :
" as a example , consider the treatment of the civet cat , a highly intelligent and sociable animal .
civet cat be trap and place in small cage inside darken shed , where the temperature be keep up to 110 F by fire .
they be confine in this way until they finally die .
what justify this extraordinary mistreatment ?
these animal have the misfortune to produce a substance that be useful in the manufacture of perfume .
musk , which be scrape from they genitals once a day for as long as they can surv ive , make the scent of perfume last a bit longer after each application .
( the heat increase they " production " of musk . )
here Kant 's rule -- " animal be merely means to a end ; that end be man " -- be apply with a vengeance .
to promote one of the most trivial interest we have , thousand of animal be torment for they whole life . "
this article , and specifically this piece , effect I enough to try to build a song around the topic .
if anyone be interested in listen to this song , and in offer they opinion , whether it be positive or negative , I would appreciate it .
but I also hope no one feel any obligation to download , especially if you have a internet connection as slow mine ( 28 k ) .
the url for the song be http://www.sonic.net/~fsjob/tragicore-thecivetcat.mp3
although there be no human vocal / lyric , I think it's subject matter be audible .
again , if anyone want to read Rachels 's entire article , let I know .
it be also on the net .
I be already a vegetarian when I read it a little more than a year ago , but it be one of the bigger factor for I in go completely vegan .
I hope all be well .

Blue Planet : who be afraid of Big Bad Wolf ?
by Dan Whipple
UNITED PRESS INTERNATIONAL
Boulder , CO , Feb. 23 ( UPI ) --
ever since he eat up Red Riding Hood 's grandma and blow down the house of two - third of the Three Little Pigs , the Big Bad Wolf have hold a persistently bad reputation .
in part because of that reputation , the gray wolf be nearly exterminate from the lower 48 state by the 1920 , except for a small remnant population on Isle Royale National Park in Michigan 's Lake Superior .
the last wolf be kill in Yellowstone National Park in 1943 .
western sheep and cattle rancher , on whose behalf this extermination campaign be conduct , gratefully dust they hand of the wolf and write he off as a job well do .
they sheep could graze , they cow could ruminate and never a discouraging word would be hear .
after the major kill - off , wolf outside of Alaska and Canada exist mostly as legend .
like ufo or Sasquatch , several people claim to see fleeting lone wolf , usually in Yellowstone .
in the 1960 , a group shoot a movie in the Wyoming park reportedly import some captive wolf , then release they when they shooting be done .
if so , this happy band have not be hear from since .
rumor also have it some renegade biologist bring a cage pair to Yellowstone and release they into the wild sometime in the 1970 , hope to reestablish a breed population .
if true , the caper fail .
over time , the wolf 's absence seem to rehabilitate its image .
eventually , a trickle of support appear for bring the predator back to its former home range in the northern Rocky Mountains .
this trickle grow into a flood , result in 14 wolf be reintroduce in Yellowstone in 1995 by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service -- albeit over the strong and still - continue objection of rancher .
these wolf pack have flourish , and now there be a estimate 850 wolf roam the northern Rockies , where merely 10 year ago there be none .
one compelling argument for reintroduction be the wolf act as a keystone predator , a animal that affect the population , behavior and ecology of a wide variety of species within its range .
some recent research conduct by Oregon State University have give considerable credence to this idea .
OSU forestry professor William Ripple and Robert Beschta have find that wolf actually promote stream - bank stabilization , although they have give the phenomenon the unfortunate name of " the ecology of fear " -- something that smack of the horrible pr result from the wolf 's relationship with Riding Hood and the Three Pigs .
they explain that elk in Yellowstone use to browse unmolested on young aspen and willow grow near the bank of stream , a behavior that prevent the sapling from reach mature stage and increase the possibility of soil erosion .
since reintroduction , however , Ripple and Beschta have find , fear of the wolf apparently have discourage the elk from spend too much time at stream bank -- where they be out in the open -- and munch on the sapling .
" all you have to do be look at the photograph , " Ed Bangs , wolf recovery coordinator for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service , tell UPI 's Blue Planet ,
" you say , ' wow ! '
a area that use to be bald as a billiard ball be now a sea of willow . "
this simple change have trigger a veritable ecological cascade in Yellowstone .
more streamside willow and aspen have mean better habitat for beaver , for instance .
where there have be only one beaver colony in the park 's northern range before the wolf return , now there be nine .
" it may be uninteresting to a lot of people , " Beschta tell Blue Planet .
" there be a lot of impact on plant and they say , ' who care ? '
but we have be look at streamside community .
since wolf recovery , streamside plant , willow and cottonwood provide food for other critter -- beaver , a whole variety of avian species , berry - produce shrub that bear can use .
it be important with regard to the quality of stream .
the plant provide shade and root strength for bank stability .
plant be critical to wildland ecosystem . "
Yellowstone have a vast elk herd , one of the largest in the world .
Bangs say although the number of elk have not decline very much since the wolf come back , they behavior appear markedly different .
" I be pretty suspicious of make broad generalization , " however , he caution .
" wolf be still pretty new .
they have only be there for 10 year .
in 10 more year we will have a better idea . "
wolf reintroduction in the northern Rockies have be so successful the Fish and Wildlife Service have move to reduce the animal 's status from endangered to threatened and , eventually , to remove it from the endangered species list altogether .
Bangs say the agency have establish viable wolf pack in the northern Rockies , as require by federal regulation .
some conservationist want the protection extend so wolf can move into other state , include Colorado , Utah and Oregon , among other .
on Jan. 31 , Oregon Federal District Court Judge Robert E. Jones appear to agree with they .
he vacate the FWS decision to downgrade the wolf 's status .
Bangs say he agency be still review the decision .
regardless of the wolf 's legal status , its future expansion into new area now seem likely .
wolf can migrate considerable distance .
meanwhile , he reputation seem to be improve , although Bangs note a " pretty interesting social dynamic . "
there be only about 850 wolf in the west , but there be a estimate 31,000 mountain lion .
they even occasionally attack people , which wolf do not -- despite the propaganda from the Brothers Grimm .
yet people seem willing -- even eager -- to accommodate mountain lion , despite the risk .
it remain to be see whether they will extend the same courtesy to the arrive gray wolf .
regard those rumor about wolf live in Yellowstone prior to the official reintroduction ?
they seem to be just that : rumor .
true , there be about 300,000 wolf and wolf hybrid keep as pet in the United States .
it also be likely people have release some of these animal into the wild hope they would survive -- for instance , a ranger in Glacier Park catch someone in this very act not long ago .
Bangs say these animal be not equip to survive in the wild , however , and they all almost certainly have die .
he say after 10 year of dna testing on northern Rockies wolf , scientist have not find a single strain that do not belong to one of the wolf the agency release -- or they descendant .

climate : human fuss , animal adjust
by Dan Whipple
UNITED PRESS INTERNATIONAL
Boulder , CO , Nov. 15 ( UPI ) --
scientist can argue all they want about how many degree Celsius -- or Fahrenheit -- the planet be warm and what the trend portend , but meanwhile Earth 's plant , insect and animal be not wait for the outcome .
they already be alter they pattern of behavior in response to what be happen .
it turn out one of the surest barometer of the warm climate be the response of the non-human natural world to change condition , and biologist who study the response have be aware for some year the biosphere be acknowledge global warming .
Nina Leopold Bradley , a plant ecologist and daughter of the conservation pioneer Aldo Leopold , publish a 1999 paper in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences on she 61 - year uninterrupted phenological record .
phenology study a organism 's development and life cycle -- the pulse of life .
Bradley 's record of 300 phenophase find that even prior to 1999 , spring be arrive in higher latitudes several week earlier than in the earlier year of she data .
bird arrive sooner on they migration from the south and plant flower earlier .
the eastern phoebe be show up about 20 day before it use to .
the forest phlox be bloom in late April instead of mid-May .
half of the 300 phenophase Leopold track show a response consistent with warming .
in England , the cuckoo return earlier .
Pew researcher look at about 40 study that could provide a assessment of whether climate be affect biology .
" half of the study provide strong evidence of a causal link between the biological change and climate change , " say Camille Parmesan , a University of Texas - Austin biologist and one of the world 's lead expert on this issue .
these change be occur across all species , Parmesan tell UPI 's Climate .
" across the United States , the northern edge of species 's range be expand , " she say .
Parmesan have spend much of she career study the checkerspot butterfly , which migrate between Mexico and southern California .
some localize extinction already have occur across some of its habitat .
" empirical research point to climate as be a strong driver , " she say .
" there have be large number of population extinction in Mexico and southern California in area where the habitat be still acceptable . "
accord to Parmesan 's earlier study , one extinction event , for instance , be trigger when a checkerspot population migrate north prematurely , rely on a warm temperature signal , then be catch in a severe snowstorm in its northern habitat .
tree swallow be nest nine day earlier .
tropical species have move up to Florida and the Gulf Coast .
bird and butterfly watcher be see many , many new species come up from Mexico and the Caribbean . "
such consequence include shifting and , in some case , contraction of range and change in species composition within ecosystem .
the report also find alteration of ecosystem process such as carbon cycling and storage .
the Pew report coincide with the release in Iceland of the " Arctic Climate Impact Assessment . "
the ACIA -- with participation by the United States , Canada , Denmark , Finland , Iceland , Norway , the Russian Federation and Sweden -- be begin in 2000 .
" the impact of global warming be affect people now in the Arctic , " say ACIA chair Robert Corell .
" the Arctic be experience some of the most rapid and severe climate change on Earth .
the impact of climate change on the region and the globe be project to increase substantially in the year to come . "
the ACIA find arctic winter temperature have increase 4 degree to 7 degree Fahrenheit in the last 50 year and should go up about twice that much in the next 100 year .
arctic summer sea ice will decline by 50 percent by the end of the 21st century , the assessment find , with some model predict complete disappearance of summer sea ice .
" should the Arctic Ocean become ice - free in summer , it be likely that polar bear and some seal species would be drive toward extinction , " the report conclude .
as with so much climate research , not everyone agree with these dire prediction .
on the one hand , the IPN report agree " climate model generally predict that the temperature rise in the Arctic will substantially exceed the global rise .
this apply especially in the high Arctic where the ice cover be expect to diminish substantially with the effect that the surface absorption of solar radiation will greatly increase . "
on the other hand , the report think the news might not be so bad for the North Atlantic fishery .
" the impact of global warming on fish stock and fishery be hard to judge , " the IPN report say .
" a warming of the magnitude predict be more likely than not to be beneficial to the fishery of the North Atlantic . "
the important commercial species that probably would benefit from warming include cod , haddock , saithe , herring , blue whiting and several type of flatfish and crustacean -- such as the Norway lobster .
important species that probably would decline include shrimp , capelin , Greenland halibut and some variety of flatfish .
hide in this laundry list -- and in the pile of study examine by the Pew researcher -- be one of the fundamental chasm divide participant in the global warming debate .
the IPN report examine commercial fish species , but it neglect important non-commercial animal , such as seal and polar bear .
in a limited economic sense , therefore , the organization can argue warming might be a good thing .
the problem be whether one care what happen to the polar bear , checkerspot butterfly and other unconsumable .
the Pew researcher try to transcend the economic argument .
they assume a value -- unspecified -- for non-commercial species , and in do so render the warming news a bit less rosy .
this tug - of - war over calculate economic value be the one that ultimately will have to be decide by human , because animal and plant can adjust only so much .
" when dandelion have set the mark of May on Wisconsin pasture , it be time to listen for the final proof of spring , " write Aldo Leopold in " a Sand County Almanac . "
or maybe not .
Climate be a weekly series by UPI examine the impact of global climate change .
preamble from BBC lead to the comment further below .
feel free to cut and paste and leave you comment , as these viewpoint cover the entire gamut surround the event .
how have Katrina change the US ?
what will be the last effect of Hurricane Katrina and what can be learn from the response ?
relief agency be try to help hundred of thousand of displace people while authority have vow to restore security in New Orleans follow a breakdown of law and order .
in the world press , commentator predict that Katrina will make a profound change in the way the US be perceive at home and abroad , especially follow the scene of poverty and racial division they believe the disaster have reveal .
meanwhile , President George W Bush have say he will lead a inquiry into how the disaster be handle .
how have Katrina change the US ?
have it alter you life ?
have the disaster affect the way other country view the US ?
send we you comment use the form .
some of the better comment :
" as a American , I would like to take this opportunity to tell all the ' USA and Bush basher ' that I be appal at the number of ' ally ' that be use this disaster as they podium to spread they useless opinion .
you have see the picture .
you people think it be race , but it be not .
it be the welfare society that be New Orleans . "
-- Paul , Atlanta , USA
" I be frankly revolt by the response of the Bush - basher ; " sorry chap , but you do have it come ... "
the plain fact be that Bush have a sight more in the way of common humanity than a great many of he detractor .
at least he be not use this disaster for cheap political point - scoring . "
-- Mac , Nottingham
" I do not feel it have change the US citizen which be what be need , even now the majority want " gas " despite the fact they be pollute the world more than any other country in the world and refuse to stop , perhaps this natural disaster , which let 's face it look like a product of global warming , will change they view , why not pick thing up with you hand and walk with you leg , other people in the world do it , " gas " be not the be all and end all ! "
-- David , Kent
< this man have clearly never visit the US .
distance be not what they be in the old world .
here , car be absolutely necessary , and he would have to have one , too .
- Juggernaut >
" the US will work its way through the loss of a city and we be make progress after seven short day .
thank you for you concern , but Europe be still irrelevant . "
-- John B , Windermere , Florida
< John can come over to eat at my house anytime .
- Juggernaut >
it be always interesting what spin the press will take .
certainly , representation of the US in other country will have a certain depiction .
I do not believe that folk who believe that America be the land of opportunity will change they view from this recent news .
I have a friend who come here from Bulgaria after win a green card in a lottery .
yes , she and she family be delighted to leave the communistic remnant in that country .
she husband become a citizen of the US just the week before last .
( believe it or not , it take a minimum of 5 year to apply . )
the country which be give to America to aid be a great example of the seed that America have sow through the year with other nation .
now to the poverty stricken and the racial issue ...
you know , I have live in the Dallas / Fort Worth metroplex most of my life .
when not in Texas , I live in LA and San Francisco .
the fact be , when I begin travel for business to New England , when I first visit my in - law in Montana and Idaho , I be shocked at the lack of racial diversity .
I do not expect to react that way , but when I be look around my workplace in Nashua , New Hampshire , and everyone else look pretty much like I , it be really very eerie .
so , yes , America have pocket that be more diverse than other .
additionally , review the standing of Louisiana and Mississippi in the educational stake , you will find they usually land near the bottom of a list of 50 state .
unfortunately , those leave behind to be film , where those without transportation or means .
some refuse to leave , but so many be unable to .
yes , it be a valid reflection of America - we do have city like this .
however , New Orleans also have many affluent people , people who leave town early as they have the means .
I do not know if this will change other nation 's perception of America .
I suspect it will not change greatly ... but you never know how much stock people put in the news .
I do know that this will change the face of America .
I expect that many of the displace people ( those affluent and those not ) will remain in the place they be evacuate to .
the 1.25 million people who have be house in stadium and convention center across Texas will begin to populate Houston , Dallas , San Antonio and Galveston , and the surround area .
sure , some will return , but I have a feeling that once many begin to get job and temporary housing , they may be shy about return .
I be interested in what America will look like in 5 year .
will racial diversity find its way to Wyoming as some people be offer job there ?
or will the nearly year - round snow be too much for those who have never experience snow in they life ?
will the housing market in Dallas begin boom like the rest of the nation have due to the influx of buyer ?
will business that be new in 2005 have become a household name due to they effort in rebuild the gulf coast ?
what will the federal government do to prevent inflation in the housing and building market ?
these be some of the thing I have be wonder ...
response come soon .
you reply be good and deserve something good in return .
okay , I be new to this forum and really do not like Bush , so my view point be slanted and I admit that .
I rarely listen to the news or to what politician or lawyer say because so many tell lie that none have credibility so what be the point ?
what I know be that I have a close friend who's aunt disappear in New Orleans .
my friend do not have computer capability , so I spend the day search and post online .
the family here ( California ) want to fly any family member from there to CA , so they could remain here until thing get straighten out down there .
the cousin could not be find because no one be sure of they married name .
the hope be that anyone look for the aunt would see the family post and know that help be available .
it be Oct. 6 , and not one family member have be locate .
what I see be dozen of school bus submerge that could have be use to evacuate people who have no transportation .
what I hear be the Mayor of New Orleans , say that he do not order the bus or anything else to be use because he be wait on someone else to tell he what to do .
when common sense take a back seat to politics and legal mumbo jumbo what have we become ?
recently , Bush address the nation .
about 30 seconds into he address , he start flog the terrorist issue just one more time .
ironically he almost burst out laugh and it be all he could do to keep he mirth down to a barely control smirk .
even he can not believe that he be trot out this old saw again .
I guess if you have a schtick that be a resounding success once , you can not help but trot it out every time you act be go sour .
meanwhile , every pocket that can be line be golden and the poor be shunt off radar yet again .
the gall of it all be that Bush be stump for more money to build more refinery , when what he should do be pour money into make the US independent of OPEC or crude oil all together .
we have the technology ; if you be go to spend billion of dollar tout " freedom " why not spend those billion make all of we free ?
free of polution , free of oil dependency , and free of big business that be bleed we dry for the short term good ( theirs ) .
I be sorry he make I want to puke so I shut he off .
in the meanwhile there be still break family that should have be safe in the home of the brave .

the highly coloured lithograph of the faithful hero seem to look dimly , in the light of one candle , at the man with no faith in anything except the truth of he own sensation .
he turn away .
he could bear no longer that expressionless and motionless stare , which seem to have a sort of impenetrable emptiness like the black depth of a abyss .
at night , however , he sleep alone , and the avenger might find he .

Lopez address the note which I have write , seal it with he sleeve - link , and send it by the hand of the servant , Jose .
how they murder he I do not know , save that it be Murillo 's hand who strike he down , for Lopez have remain to guard I .
I believe he must have wait among the gorse bush through which the path wind and strike he down as he pass .
at first they be of a mind to let he enter the house and to kill he as a detect burglar ; but they argue that if they be mix up in a inquiry they own identity would at once be publicly disclose and they would be open to further attack .

the rock revolution happen in the sixty ( 6 , number of the Beast ) .
it come from Liverpool , that be the port base to the Titanic , destroy by God because of the arrogant insult of captain Smith ( also from Liverpool ) : " not even God can sink my ship " ( not only the captain , but also the rest of the crew and even the orchestra play at the Titanic be from Liverpool ) .
the rock revolution come from the nation that allow a church to be change to a pub or to a dance room or to a recording studio full of drug addict , homosexual and lunatic ( as that of George Martin , ally of the Beatles ) .
it be interest to observe that this nation be nickname " the Devil 's Island " .
as the epithet of the government of Satan on that nation , the center of London , the so well - know Piccadilly Circus , take it's name from a old brothel ( the " Piccadilla House " which mean " the House of Sin " ) , disappeared nowadays .
the antichrist John Lennon , one of the Devil 's main puppet to destroy family , social and moral value and to begin the disintegration of mankind , do hit Stuart Sutcliffe ( the first bass player of the Beatles ) in the head with a club repeatedly in Hamburg .
some month later Sutcliffe die from brain haemorrhage because of John Lennon 's bruise .
John Lennon enter stardom be a murderer .
the same demon that make captain Smith say " not even God can sink my ship " speak from antichrist John Lennon ( from Liverpool , base port to the Titanic ) say : " Christianity be on the go .
it will vanish and shrink .
we be more popular than Jesus and Pope " ....
that be the day that GOD 's CURSE fall upon the world of rock .
one week after that declaration , only one week later , Brian Epstein , forger of the Beatle farce , die from a overdose .
from then on , the Beatles begin to get involved in false religion and to preach they to the world .

Antichrist John Lennon want to compete with Jesus Christ , and so he grow a beard and start to make a bogus role of Christ together with Yoko Ono at the Amsterdam Hilton hotel proclaim " peace " , be then when he be visit by the canadian journalist who ridiculize and admonish he want to know about what Lennon mean when he write in the lyric of " the ballad of John and Yoko " : " the way thing be go , they be go to crucify I ... " , the curse of GOD upon John Lennon carry on with all type of misery and distress which make Lennon give the interview to the " Rolling Stone " magazine ( today condense in the " Lennon remember " book ) where he speak about how bad thing be go for he blame " whatever be up there " for it ( refer to God ) .
the curse of GOD carry on until he be shoot dead .
it be interesting to notice that he be shoot seven time , be seven , as well as three , the holy number in holy cabalah tradition ....
the advertising farce of how much he love Linda ( woman whose quality he do not deserve ) , be expose when it be know that Paul have a affair with Heather Mills , Linda 's intimate friend , with whom McCartney go on a trip to New York and to whom he buy thing and present , while he be still mourn for he " dear Linda " .
at the same time McCartney be go out with Heather Mills , he use Linda 's death for promotional end , due to he wane popularity .
Paul be go out with Heather , but in front of the audience he play the faithful husband 's masquerade pretend to suffer for Linda , for the afore mentioned promotional end .
Paul admit that he make Linda suffer a lot , but he do not say that it be because he feel insecure as a man due to he womanish face and effeminate manners and also because with he age he sexual power be not the same , even though it have never be much .
the early day be the day of competition between Paul and he wife and John and he wife and he know he have to compete with ugly John for the leadership of the band in front of they wife and have Yoko Ono make he aware of he lack of virility and repress homosexuality , he grow the beard that we see in the " let it be " film and start to show picture of naked woman in the same film , do every effort he could to be see as a man ....
it be easy to note the uneasiness of McCartney when he sing : " I have get a feeling , a feeling I can not hide ... " in front of Yoko in the film .
( he already have the trauma that he previous girlfriend Jane Asher have cause he when she make he aware of he little manliness and effeminate manners ) .
this be something that he ego trip of lucky bad musician could not face anymore ....
he be very conscious that money and fame can not buy virility and manliness .
besides be a murderer , John Lennon have sexual intercourse with homosexual Brian Epstein to get he interested in go to see the band at the Cavern , trauma from which he never recover .
the Beatles be very well know by people close to they for they arrogance and racism .
one of the manifestation of they racism be the rejection towards japanese Yoko Ono .
that rejection get to the point that George Harrison kick Yoko Ono in the Apple studio during the filming of let it be .
when John ask George while they be have lunch about how thing be go for Paul after he separation from the Beatles and George reply that he be number one in the swedish hit parade , John say in a despective manner : " ah !! .. in Sweden .. " , as if Sweden be a inferior place or something alike .
in the Beatles 's song " get back " they advise black Joe to " get back to where you once belong " , as if England be not a place for black people .
sometimes back , Paul tell George in the Apple office that the new generation be a bundle of idiot and useless people , but in any way they would have also be slave of the Beatles .
the jewish marriage live to the right of George 's house say that he be a arrogant person who do never return a greeting .
the newly marry couple live on the corner in front of the entrance of George 's house ( Friar Park ) refer to he as a overbearing person to stay away from .
the receptionist of " Hand made " , the former film making company of George Harrison say : " we do not have any relation with that man anymore and we do not want to know anything about he " .
it be interesting to note that this company be make bankrupt by the british cinema industry due to the despotism and pedantry of George Harrison , who believe that the cinema industry would have worship he .
they chauvinism get to the point that even they themselves hate each other .
Paul McCartney say that George Harrison be a nothing .
George Harrison say that he be tired of listen to people talk about John Lennon ....
without George Martin the Beatles would have be just another untalented band as Oasis ....
Paul McCartney say recently that he believe in use magic , and he do lot of charity , think that in this way he will compensate for the curse of GOD that be upon he and that take he wife 's life because of he Satanism and involvement in black magic .
he think he will deceive people in this way , so that the real McCartney will not be perceive .
Satan deceive mankind once again , as so many other thousand of time through the century ....
after the Devil begin he devastating job from the ghostly " Devil 's Island " through he nine main puppet ( Beatles - Rolling Stones ) , he possess a endless amount of other schizophrenic bad musician in the afore mentioned island and weaken they conscience with drug , he make they proclaimer of homosexuality , aversion to religion , destruction of family value , dissipation , mental illness , antisocialism , etc. , etc. ,
the fact that bad apprentice musician such as the Beatles and the Rolling Stones achieve such a giant fame that not even the real quality musician could achieve , be because the force of Satan be behind everything , support the process .

attack on Iran : a loom folly
by William Rivers Pitt
t r u t h o u t | perspective
Monday 09 January 2006
the wire have be hum since before the new year with report that the Bush administration be plan a attack on Iran .
" the Bush administration be prepare its NATO ally for a possible military strike against suspect nuclear site in Iran in the New Year , accord to german media report , reinforce similar earlier suggestion in the turkish media , " report UPI on December 30th .
" the Berlin daily Der Tagesspiegel this week , " continue UPI , " quote ' NATO intelligence source ' who claim that the NATO ally have be inform that the United States be currently investigate all possibility of bring the mullah - lead regime into line , include military option .
this ' all option be open ' line have be President George W Bush 's publicly state policy throughout the past 18 month . "
a examination of the ramification of such a attack be desperately in order .
1 . blowback in Iraq
the recent election in Iraq be dominate by a amalgam of religiously fundamentalist shi'ite organization , principally the Dawa Party and the Supreme Council for Islamic Revolution in Iraq ( SCIRI ) .
both Dawa and SCIRI have umbilical connection to the fundamentalist shi'ite leadership in Iran that go back decade .
in essence , Iran now own a significant portion of the iraqi government .
should the United States undertake military action against Iran , the ramification in Iraq would be immediate and extreme .
in the first eight day of January , eighteen US troops have be kill in Iraq , compound by another twelve death from a Black Hawk helicopter crash on Saturday .
much of the violence aim at american force be come from disgruntled sunni faction that have they own militia , believe the last election be a sham , and hold little political power in the government .
if the US attack Iran , it be probable that american force - already tax by attack from sunni faction - will also face reprisal attack in Iraq from shi'ite faction loyal to Iran .
the result will be a dramatic escalation in US and civilian casualty , US force will be require to bunker themselves further into they basis , and US force will find themselves require to fight the very government they just finish help into power .
Iraq , already a seethe cauldron , will sink further into chaos .
2 . Iran 's armament
unlike Iraq , Iran have not spend the last fifteen year have its conventional force wear down by grueling sanction , repeat attack , and two american - lead war .
while Iran 's conventional army be not what it be during the heyday of the Iran - Iraq war - they armament have deteriorate and the veteran of that last war have retire - the nation enjoy substantial military strength nonetheless .
accord to a report issue by the Center for Strategic and International Studies in December of 2004 , Iran " have some 540,000 man under arm and over 350,000 reserve .
they include 120,000 Iranian Revolutionary Guards train for land and naval asymmetrical warfare .
Iran 's military also include holding of 1,613 main battle tank , 21,600 other armored fighting vehicle , 3,200 artillery weapon , 306 combat aircraft , 60 attack helicopter , 3 submarine , 59 surface combatant , and 10 amphibious ship . "
" Iran be now the only regional military power that pose a significant conventional military threat to Gulf stability , " continue the CSIS report .
" Iran have significant capability for asymmetric warfare , and pose the additional threat of proliferation .
there be considerable evidence that it be develop both a long - range missile force and a range of weapon of mass destruction .
it have never properly declare its holding of chemical weapon , and the status of its biological weapon program be unknown . "
a MILNET brief issue in February 2005 report , " due to its position astride the Persian Gulf , Iran have constantly be a threat to the gulf .
the so call ' tanker ' war in the late 1980 put Iran squarely in the bullseye of all nation seek to transport oil out of the region .
even the small navy that Iran put to sea be capable enough to harass shipping , and several case of small boat operation against oil well head in the gulf during that period make it clear small asymmetrical tactic of the iranian navy could be quite effective . "
" more concerning , " continue the MILNET brief , " be the priority place on expand and modernize its navy .
the CSIS report cite numerous area where Iran have fund modernization include the most troublesome aspect , anti-shipping cruise missile : ' Iran have obtain new anti-ship missile and missile patrol craft from China , midget submarine from North Korea , submarine from Russia , and modern mine . ' "
it be Iran 's missile armament that pose the greatest concern for american force in the gulf , especially for the US Navy .
Iran 's coast face the Persian Gulf be a loom wall of mountain that look down upon any naval force array in those water .
the gulf itself only have one exit , the Strait of Hormuz , which be also dominate by the mountainous iranian coastline .
in essence , Iran hold the high ground in the gulf .
missile battery array in those mountain could raise bloody havoc with any fleet deploy below .
of all the missile in Iran 's armament , the most dangerous be the russian - make SS - N - 22 Sunburn .
these missile be , simply , the fastest anti-ship weapon on the planet .
the Sunburn can reach Mach 3 at high altitude .
its maximum low - altitude speed be mach 2.2 , some three time faster than the american - make Harpoon .
the Sunburn take two short minute to cover its full range .
the missile 's manufacturer state that one or two missile could cripple a destroyer , and five missile could sink a 20,000 ton ship .
the Sunburn be also superior to the Exocet missile .
recall that it be two Exocets that rip the USS Stark to shred in 1987 , kill 37 sailor .
the Stark could not see they to stop they .
the US aircraft carrier Theodore Roosevelt be currently deploy in the Persian Gulf , with some 7,000 soul aboard .
sail with the Roosevelt be the Tarawa Expeditionary Strike Force , which include the USS Tarawa , the USS Austin , and the USS Pearl Harbor .
the USS Austin be likewise deploy in the gulf .
the Sunburn missile , with its incredible speed and ability to avoid radar detection , would do terrible damage these ship if Iran choose to retaliate in the gulf after a american attack within its border .
beyond the naval threat be the possibility of Iran throw its military muscle into the ongoing struggle in Iraq .
currently , the US be face a asymmetrical attack from group wield small arm , shoulder - fire grenade and roadside bomb .
the vaunted american military have suffer 2,210 death and ten of thousand of wounded from this form of warfare .
the occupation of Iraq have become a guerrilla war , a siege that have last more than a thousand day .
if Iran decide to throw any or all of its 23,000 armored fighting vehicle , along with any or all of its nearly million - strong army , into the Iraq fray , the situation in the Middle East could become unspeakably dire .
3 . the syrian connection
in February of 2005 , Iran and Syria agree upon a mutual protection pact to combat " challenge and threat " in the region .
a attack on Iran would trigger this mutual defense pact , and could conceivably bring Syria into direct conflict with american force .
like Iran , Syria 's military be nothing to scoff at .
virtually every credible analysis have Syria stand as the strongest military force in the Middle East after Israel .
Damascus have be intent for year upon establish significant military strength to serve as a counterweight to Israel 's overwhelming capability .
as of 2002 , Syria have some 215,000 soldier under arm , 4,700 tank , and a massive artillery capability .
the syrian Air Force be comprise of ten to eleven fighter / attack squadron and sixteen fighter squadron , total somewhere near 650 aircraft .
Syria also possess one of the largest arsenal of ballistic missile in the region , comprise primarily of SCUD - derive system .
Iran , North Korea and China have be willing provider of state - of - the - art technology .
compound this be the well - base suspicion that Syria have perhaps the most advanced chemical weapon capability in the Persian Gulf .
4 . China and the US economy
while the ominous possibility of heighten iraqi chaos , missile in the gulf , and syrian involvement loom large if the US attack Iran , all pale in comparison to the involvement of China in any US / Iran engagement .
China 's economy be explode , hamper only by they great thirst for petroleum and natural gas to fuel they industry .
China will purchase 250 million ton of liquefy natural gas from Iran over the next 30 year , will develop the massive Yadavaran oil field in Iran , and will receive 150,000 barrel of oil per day from that field .
China be seek the construction of a pipeline from Iran to the Caspian Sea , where it would link with another plan pipeline run from Kazakhstan to China .
any US attack on Iran could be perceive by China as a direct threat to its economic health .
further , any fighting in the Persian Gulf would imperil the tanker run China 's liquefy natural gas through the Strait of Hormuz .
should China decide to retaliate against the US to defend its oil and natural gas deal with Iran , the US would be face with a significant threat .
this threat exist not merely on a military level , though China could force a confrontation in the Pacific by way of Taiwan .
more significantly , China hold a large portion of the american economy in the palm of its hand .
Paul Craig Roberts , write for the American Conservative , say in July of 2005 that " as a result of many year of persistent trade surplus with the United States , the japanese government hold dollar reserve of approximately $ 1 trillion .
China 's accumulation of dollar be approximately $ 600 billion .
South Korea hold about $ 200 billion .
these sum give these country enormous leverage over the United States .
by dump some portion of they reserve , these country could put the dollar under intense pressure and send U.S. interest rate skyrocket .
Washington would really have to anger Japan and Korea to provoke such action , but in a showdown with China - over Taiwan , for example - China hold the card .
China and Japan , and the world at large , have more dollar reserve than they require .
they would have no problem teach a hegemonic superpower a lesson if the need arise . "
" the hardest blow on Americans , " conclude Roberts , " will fall when China do revalue its currency .
when China 's currency cease to be undervalue , american shopper in Wal - Mart , where 70 percent of the goods on the shelf be make in China , will think they be in Neiman Marcus .
price increase will cause a dramatic reduction in american real income .
if this coincide with rise interest rate and a setback in the housing market , american consumer will experience the hardest time since the Great Depression . "
in short , China have the american economy by the throat .
should they decide to squeeze , we will all feel it .
China 's strong hand in this even extend to the diplomatic realm ; China be a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council , and could veto any action against Iran propose by the United States .
5 . american preparedness
american citizen have for decade take it as a given that we military can overwhelm and overcome any foe on the battlefield .
the rapid victory during the first Gulf War cement this perception .
the last three year of the Iraq occupation , however , have sap this confidence .
worse , the occupation have do great damage to the strength of the american military , justify the decrease in confidence .
thanks to repeat deployment to Iraq and Afghanistan , recruiting be at a all - time low .
soldier with vital training and know - how be refuse to re-enlist .
across the board , the american military be stretch to the breaking point .
two vaunted economist - one a Nobel Prize winner and the other a nationally renowned budget expert - have analyze the data at hand and put a price tag on the Iraq occupation .
accord to Linda Bilmes of Harvard and Nobel Laureate Joseph E. Stiglitz of Columbia University , the final cost of the Iraq occupation will run between $ 1 trillion and $ 2 trillion , surpass by order of magnitude the estimate put forth by the Bush administration .
if a engagement with Iran envelop we force in Iraq , and come to involve Syria , we economy will likely shatter under the strain of fight so many country simultaneously .
add to this the economic threat pose by China , and the economic threat implicit in any substantial disruption of the distribution of Mideast petroleum to the globe .
if Iran and Syria - with they significant armament , missile technology and suspect chemical weapon capability - decide to engage with the relatively undersized US force in Iraq , we troops there will be fish in a barrel .
Iran 's position over the gulf would make resupply by ship and air support from carrier a dangerous affair .
in the worst - case scenario , the newly - mint american order of battle require the use of nuclear weapon to rescue a surround and imperil force could come into play , hurl the entire planet into military and diplomatic bedlam .
conclusion : be any of this possible ?
it be difficult to imagine a justification for any action that could envelop the United States in a military and economic conflict with Iraq , Iran , Syria and China simultaneously .
Iran be suspect by many nation of work towards the development of nuclear weapon , but even this justification have be toss into a cocked hat .
recently , russian president Vladimir Putin bluntly state that Iran be not develop its nuclear capability for any reason beyond peaceful energy creation , and pledge to continue assist Iran in this endeavor .
therefore , any attack upon Iran 's nuclear facility will bring Russia into the mess .
Iran also stand accuse of aid terrorism across the globe .
the danger implicit in any attack upon that nation , however , seem to significantly offset whatever gain could be make in the so - call " war on terror . "
unfortunately , all the danger in the world be no match for the self - assurance of a bubble - encase zealot .
what manner of maniac would undertake such a dangerous course ?
look no further than 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue .
George W. Bush and he administration have consistently undertake incredibly dangerous course of action in order to garner political power on the home front .
recall the multiple terror threat lob out by the administration whenever damaging political news appear in the media .
more significantly , recall Iraq .
Karl Rove , Bush 's most senior advisor , notoriously tell Republicans on the ballot during the 2002 midterm to " run on the war . "
the invasion of Iraq provide marvelous political cover for the GOP not only during those midterm , but during the 2004 presidential election .
what kind of political cover would be gain from a attack on Iran , and from the diversion of attention to that attack ?
the answer lie in one now - familiar name : Jack Abramoff .
the Abramoff scandal threaten to subsume all the hard - fight GOP gain in Congress , and the 2006 midterm be less than a year away .
be any of this a probability ?
logic say no , but logic seldom play any part in modern american politics .
all argument that the Bush administration would be insane to attack Iran and risk a global conflagration for the sake of political cover run into one unavoidable truth .
they do it once already in Iraq .

equine collage uk need help !!!?
no one employ people from Hartpury because of what they receive on work experience .
Merrist Wood ( I be there on a nvq equine course ) do hnd in equine management .
you best bet be to look on UCAS and do a course search .
Merrist Wood in Woking in Surrey .
Moreton Morrell in Coventry , Warwickshire
Hartpury College ( I think that be the name , but if you type it in it should come up with a alternative suggestion ) , in Gloucestershire .
go onto the UCAS website , go onto course search and search for the course you want to do .
they will give you a comprehensive list of all the university that do the course you want , plus all the information you need to apply .
in fact Philippines be famous to accept people like these people i mention whose not filipinos but help the Philippines to plunge in the pit as they be the rot of the country .
they need to be expulse from the country and if they be not there they should be ban enter the country to plant they egg , as they be consider as the rotten left over of dinasaur
be the texting capital of the world .

my myTouch 4G crash with most custom rom I install .
can that be fix ?
I really like the MIUI , but a process crash repeatedly about every 3 seconds .
and I can not even load the newest version of cyanogen mod .
not by the company ... as you void you warrenty by install custom rom
you be best to either recover to the standard rom , or find one that do not crash .
cynangon mod should work .
have you try use clockwork recovery ?
get the older version of Cynagon mod .
also you could use a stable rom like bugless beast and baked snake .
those rom focus on speed and stability .
or you could just use a home screen launcher replacement .
I would recommend go launcher or adw launcher .
they be both excellent and speed up the phone quite a bit .
as a mytouch 4g owner I know the phone be pretty fast and their be no point install a rom .
hope you read through this .
be the moor and penine in Yorkshire a lonely eerie place ?
and how big be they ?
i be 33 .
i have never be to the yorkshire moor or penine at all ... i can see the penine in the far distance from my bedroom window .
when i watch werewolf in london ( great film ) that be the only time i see the yorkshire moor .
can anyone give I information about they ?
they can be bleak and eerie , often very exposed , often covered with antiquity like bronze age burial mound , stone circle and settlement -- until late in the bronze age they be rich farmland , then a change in the climate cause the sky to cloud over and rain to wash the goodness from the soil .
the people abandon they farm and religious site and the ground they stand on become moorland .
they can also be very beautiful when the purple heather be out , and they be habitat to much wildlife and many species of wildflower .
I have a western pleasure appy that be really heavy on she left lead at the lope ?
my appy be very heavy on she left lead at the lope .
she seem to lope one stride and trot the next and repeat ...
how could I work with she to get off she four hand , get balance , and lope smoothly and slowly ??
put on a pair of spur and before she make that trot step , it be in the feeling when you feel she think trot , tick she with the spur and lift with you body to keep she move .
if you concentrate on that feel just before the trot you can figure it out and the timing be essential to push she at that instant .
lope she to the left in circle , keep she head to the inside of the circle and push she but out , keep do this if she break to a jog go a little bit bigger circle , till she can get enough balance to go small and small . circle
my new OLYMPUS X940 digital camera ... ?

dead pixel of my photo ?
please help I .. and what should i do to fix this problem ?
or it be normal ?
be you sure it be not dirt on the sensor ?
put the camera on manual focus and set focus to infinity
take a photo of a very light plain subject close to the lens use long exposure and smallest aperture you have - over expose by a couple of stop
you will see in the image if there be dirt as that will be the only thing in focus
cure be to get the sensor clean
there should be a pixel mapping function in the menu that will get rid of they , most sensor have a few dead and flip pixel , some only show up on long exposure .
New Zealand skilled migrant visa ?
if you apply for a skilled migrant worker 's visa and it be accept do you have to find work in the same sector as you skill on you application or can you take up other work if you can not find something in you own field .
I have post this question on the NZ visa site and can not get any info , do anyone know .???
watch out the pole be come ..... my little butterfly
that would be preferable but it do not matter , could be something similar
it depend on the condition of you skilled migrant visa .
you visa should say whether or not you be restrict to work in a specific sector .
if you visa do not restrict you from take any work in New Zealand then you can work in any sector .
it only matter if you receive a offer of employment or if you be currently work in New Zealand and use that job in you application to get you skilled migrant visa .
in Chicago , what be the best restaurant to dine at on a budget ?
downtown Chicago , Loop , North
take the red line to Clark , then you turn right .
walk 2 block then turn right again .
walk 2 more block then cross the street .
you will get to a place call " BIG BOWL " .
thai food and asian .
best place ever !!!!!!!!!!!!
not necessarily the restaurant but what you order when you get there and what time you go .
a lunch will be less expensive than a dinner .
you can order appetizer rather than a full meal and have just as good a dinner .
but the best way be to use coupon .
check out http://www.restaurant.com lot of restaurant you can look at the menu and check out price .
yo also may want to try " small neighborhood " restaurant and support family run place rather than the large corporate chain .
be there any cure for mouse poison ?
I find a poor little mouse walk around in my friend 's house , and since I be able to catch it very easily ( normally mouse move at the speed of light ) , and since it be act unresponsive , I think it be infect with mouse poison , since my friend use it .
I know that the mouse will probably die , but I be wonder if there be any cure for mouse poison ?
I just hate to see the poor dear experience a slow painful death that way :( .
without know the exact poison , no .
a common one be arsenic and there really be not a way to cure that .
take the mouse to a emergency vet and have they use co2 to put the mouse to sleep .
or , you can put the animal in a snap trap design for rat or mouse since that be the only really humane kill method for invasive animal .
a quick cure would be Arm & Hammer to it's head .

what cleaner should I use for dust around my parakeet ?
what cleaner can I use to dust around my budgie .
would pledge be ok ?
if not , what be ?
you best bet would just be a swiffer duster -- they do not require cleaner .
I have have parakeet for a very long time , and I use pledge .
just keep a window open for a while for fresh air to circulate .
I agree with the answer from Nothing .
even a cotton cloth ( I like diaper ) that be barely damp with water will work fine .
Swiffer or any type of micro-fiber cloth be excellent .
I use Miracle Cloth , they be fantastic , just do not use fabric softener or dryer sheet when clean they , it ruin they " grab " ability .

how do I take care of my newborn baby fish ?
I be nervous that my other fish will eat they , and I do not know what to feed they !
I have count around 25 of they and they currently reside in a 20 gallon tank .
you could move all the baby into a fry net breeder or move all of the bigger fish ( also the parent ) to a different tank to avoid the baby get eat .
feed the baby 3 - 4 time a day with flake .
provide plenty of hiding place like rock , plant , etc in the tank .
it be natural for some baby to be eat by adult and if all of they survive you tank would be very overcrowded .
look in the pet store for " fry food " or " baby fish food " .
what kind of newborn fish you have ?
some parent would not eat there fish till a certain age jack dempsey for example would not eat there offspring till they mature but i would move the baby fish into a smaller tank and feed they flake

bearded dragon spike ?
or be they just suppose to look like they be so nothing will try to eat they
becca be right .
they use they to look prickly .. would you try to eat a cactus [ if u have no knife ] i know i would not .
they puff out to look bigger and badder and they can scratch you a lil if u be hold they to tight :)
they be not really hard .
beardy be actually quite delicate .
I be assume it be to scare off predator / like how they will puff up they neck spike to make they look bigger to predator or enemy .
they do not hurt unless you be stupid enough to press on they .
they just be there as a adaptation .
use as a help for horse that be quite strong puller while hack , hunt and do cross country .
it be a curb bit with a ported mouth piece and some horse appreciate this to give they more room in they mouth for they tongue .
it be not as precise as a pelham bit because it only use one rein , though the modern one have two or three slot on which to put the rein .
the lower the rein , the stronger the action and the lower the rein the stronger the action on the poll too .
useful for younger kid who do not have big enough hand or the ability to handle two rein independently .
for horse that be strong puller .
it just give you a little leverage and curb pressure .
it be nice for horse that need a little more than a snaffle .
I know that be vague , but it depend on the horse .
the rider need to have independent hand as well , because you do not want to pull too hard on a bit like that . ;)

it be for a craft project ..... i want to use it the way u would use icing ....
take a bit of searching to discover that pop be probably pop - plaster of Paris and yes plaster of Paris will slow way down if it be not expose to air - in fact , if you be build up plaster ( " the way you would icing " ) to do sculpting , which be rather uncommon , you keep the set plaster damp in order to add more unset plaster or you have to wet the area where you will be add plaster " mud "
plaster of Paris do two thing
- it chemically set - get warm to hot then cool down and hard and
- it dry out , lose the water that be soak into the set structure
dwarf hamster make too much noise on wheel at night ?
I be get a dwarf hamster tomorrow and i be just talk to my Mom and she say that we have to take out the wheel at night because it would disturb she sleep but i tell she no because i say thei be energetic at night and my room be right next door to hers but i hear their be wheel that do not make noise at all what would be the price of it ?
I be quite sure , you do not even have to buy another , all you need to do , be to pour some oil on the wheel , or even put some rubber on it's edge , the part that be make the noise .
that might work
Super Pet Silent Spinner Exercise Wheel
we price : $ 10.99 to 12.99 PETSMART !
work well last long .
I have a dwarf hamster who hate he wheel and do not use it -
he make so much more noise , as he play and dig and jump ( seriously )

a few squeak from a wheel be better than the full wrath of a bored pet !
change of boarding station ?
how can I change my boarding station against the ticket I book a month back from counter ?
my origin station be Howrah , but I want to board at Asansol ..
do you train pass Asansol when start from Howrah ?
if yes , you do not need to change it because you board later .
if no , you will have to go to one of the train station .
in Calcutta there be a foreigner 's reservation office where they speak English very well .
I do not remember near which station it be though .
they can help you and it be close to a train station in Calcutta so check a few big one ?
even if you do not find the foreigner 's office you will be fine in the normal reservation office of any big train station .
this be where you can get and change express train ticket .
well if you desire boarding station come after more than 2 or 3 halt of the actual boarding point , then the tc will cancel you ticket and allot the seat to other .
so better inquire in railway office
contact the indian railway .
you might end up as a no show passenger .

I have a splitter / filter between my adsl and ph line ?
I have 2 phone run on the same line and the adsl which be connect to one of the phone and the filter , I be still get a buzzing noise even when I have disconnect the other phone without one .
why be it stil do this even though I do not have the other phone connect ?
would it be better if I get another filter and connect the other phone as well ?
turn the modem off and see if the sound be still there ... could be static on the line ... if the sound be still there with the modem off then the problem be not the dsl ....
if the trouble go away with the modem off , then make sure that everything except the modem be filter , this would include the alarm system , fax machine , satellite box , phone , etc ...
if everything be filter , and you still have this problem - try change the filter - if it be still there , try double up on the filter ...
you need either a filter for each device except the dsl modem , or a whole home filter which filter all the jack , except the one which the dsl modem connect .

hamster - will a hamster be ok live in the bathroom ?
in he cage in the bathroom ?
or would the steam from the shower be a problem ?
if space be minimal , or you be keep he in there to be keep away from other pet , then I can understand why you would choose to keep he there .
there be some thing to consider though ...
rodent require special bedding in they cage to absorb they waste , and this need to be clean regularly , or you hamster could suffer from problem due the buildup of ammonia from he urine .
when you take a warm shower and build up steam , he cage will collect water , the bedding will absorb much of it , and will not be able to absorb the urine quite as it should .
you will also have to be wary of mold form on any toy or hide - away he may have .
you also do not want it get too warm for he too often .
overall , it be not a good solution , but you can keep he healthy and pull it off if you take the time to give he the extra care he will need because of it .
it may be a problem because the temperature be constantly change .
I would personally put he somewhere else .

what should I feed it ?
be normal bird food fine ?
( petco , petsmart ) ..... thanks !
dove be a species of pigeon , they be seed eater , they do not eat bread , or worm .

if you have a pet store near buy some wheat , pigeon corn or even mix bird seed will do , but do not feed bread .

any program that you use please list :) thx
you could also try this in gimp .
it will give you a lot more power , as well as control over how you black and white photo look :
open you image while it be still in color
create a new layer and fill the later with black .
set the layer mode to " color " this will make you image blak and white .
click color >>> level and adjust each channel 's color value .
this will adjust the brightness and darkness of specific part of a image .

try something like photoscape which have different option ...
cheapest plastic surgeon in Thailand ?
I want to go to thailand to do my boob job from South Africa but look for the cheapest surgeon yet also good in he artwork on a human 's body .
only a fool would base a decision use the cheapest surgeon to perform a operation .
cheapest surgeon work out of some small clinic and do not have the skill you be look for . .
do you really want to put you faith in some clinic doctor .
I know I would not .
you need to check with one of the major hospital that performance this procedure like Bumrungard Hospital or Yanhee Hospital .
would you choose the cheapest brake for you expensive race car or maybe the cheapest parachute too ?
sometimes the " cheap " come expensive !
when you have invasive surgery you could also get infection , accidental nick and cut that cause other problem too !
Bumrungrad Hospital do some good work but all hospital do have they problem from time to time .
maybe have a experienced doctor might be better than some guy that be cheaper but less experienced !
the cheapest * high quality * plastic surgeon be at Yanhee Hospitals .
they do outstanding work .
check the link for a sampling of price .
my tom cat will not eat meat just the juice in the can .?
when I open a can of meat with gravy he lick off the gravy and let the meat lay .
I must through it away .
if you know what kind of " meat " they put in can cat food you would understand this .
I have have a lot of cat who refuse to eat the can food .
when you read the label it be easy to understand why .
I have have cat for 35 year and I only feed they dry food .
they have do very well and like the dry food better .
it have better nutritional value and it be also less expensive .
can food be often suspect as to the actual contents and you be pay for a high moisture content instead of food content .
there be a lot of good quality dry cat food .
read the label for contents .
you cat will adjust quickly .
you will also have less spoilage .
he might be sick take he to the vet to see
if he always do this , welcome to the club .
my oldest female and youngest male do this - I just grab the blender and pop in some other stuff for they like chicken liver ( cook ) for the anemic one , some arthritis stuff for the oldest .
even if you mash it with a spoon he can not do that ,
what be you favorite part about trail riding ?
my favorite part be go up hill and canter :)
I love how it really depend on how good a horse you horse really be , not how talented he be .
if you take some Olympic - level horse on a trail ride , they just could not do it .
they would be too scared and spooky .
it do not matter how graceful you horse be , or how high he can jump , or how well he do a slide stop .
what matter be how well train he be , and how good you bond it .
that be another reason why I like competitive trail riding also .
nobody pay someone to keep they horse in shape and ride once a week , then take all the ribbon at the show because they horse be good .
you have to spend the time train .
and I have not meet one stick - up trail rider !
those be just a few reason why I love trail riding , competitive or not .
same , when I be gallop in a open space like that I can just forget everything .
see the nature and wild life that if you keep quiet you can get up close and personal .
I have have several close encounter with both fox and wild deer .
also woodpecker be peck in the tree and I just sit and watch .
10 gallon nano reef idea ?
I have a 10 gallon nano reef with 10 lb of live fiji rock , and 10 lb of live carribean sand .
I be aware of the maintenance involve in keep a tank this size .
I be currently maintain a gravity level of 1.024 .
I have a 10 gallon filter on it .
I also have a powerhead , get another soon .
I have a few question , first I want to start a sump filter , but I have no idea on how the water intake and water return would work .
do I need a protein skimmer or any other equipment ?
unless the tank have a build in overflow box ( which I be certain it do not ) then you have to get one of those hang on back overflow box so that you can install a sump .
the piping would lead down into you sump from the overflow box .
on the other end of the sump , you would have a small return pump with a hose that put the water back into you tank .
if you be go to go through the trouble of create a sump for this tank , get a protein skimmer would not be a bad idea .
the Hydor SlimSkim Nano be a good nano protein skimmer , it be a in - tank design that could easily sit in you sump .
NOOK Color or NOOK Tablet ?
from what I understand they be pretty much the same thing .
some of the major difference I see be the hd video , longer battery life , and faster processor that the NOOK Tablet boast .
do the tablet have a major difference in speed compare to the Color ?
I do not want a iPad or Kindle .
I just want a e-reader that do a little bit more than just read .
or just purchase the Color ?
well I recently buy the Nook Color , and I have to say that I be very happy with it .
when I find out they come up with the Nook Tablet , I be pretty disappointed though , because I buy my Nook color for the same darn price !
so I say you should go for the more updated Nook Tablet .
I be pretty sure it will be worth it .
have fun !
judge by Nook Tablet 's processor it be suppose to be quite faster !
basically Nook Tablet it have more memory , better battery life and a better processor and a microphone .
ereader Tablet Comparison ; B & N Nook Tablet , B & N Nook Color , Kindle Fire , HTC Flyer

I want to take he somewhere where there be go to be awesome burger / american food , atmosphere ( preferably a tavern / pub style would be nice ) , good service , and all around a great time . =)
I be look for suggestion from anyone who know the philly area and the where to' .
we just move to a town outside Philly a couple of month back so I be not a expert on the area .
a little help be always great . =)

how to start a new fish tank ?
I be get a 10 gallon for my betta tomorrow and I just want to know how to properly set it up .
I be still a beginner .
any and all suggestion on what I need to do and buy will help .
when you get the tank make sure you wash the inside ( with plain water ) then you wash the gravel ( with only water too ) take out all the stuff that be float on top .
add only silk plant as plastic one may tear up ur betta 's delicate fin .
you add the water and put water conditioner into the water .
start up you filter ( sponge filter be the best for betta ) and put in a heater and set it to anywhere between 78 - 82 .
wait about 2 week or 3 and test you water .
if everything be look good you may add you betta to its new home .
light be optinal since fish need the light turn off at night anyways and a air pump be not nessasary since they get air from the surface .
ask the people sell you the fish how you should set it up , they would know
add aquasafe with the water you put in it .
make sure the temperature be good .
do not put you fish tank close to the sun or alga grow in you tank .
everything else should be good .
make sure if you get new fish that they get along with one another .
be it possible to shoot lazer out of you wang ?
I would like to learn how
I see you be still recover from the accident .
you appear to be feel better though .
that be good . :)
only in comic book and sci - fi tv show / movie ... :d
know that there be pro and con to laser sight before you mount they on you wang .
while they be extremely accurate , laser sight do not operate well when drunk or high because the beam often do not show up on the target .
therefore , you must learn to shoot manually .
mount laser sight on away by remove the hand grip .
laser grip be the most common for wang .
the laser be make into the hand grip and have a switch on the side to turn it on .
remove you finger from the exist grip and replace they with you new laser grip .
you have two adjustment screw for up and down and right to left position .
consider these point for mount laser sight on semi-automatic wang .
newer semi-automatic wang have a rail build into the receiver under the shaft .
this rail be use for multi purpose , such as laser device or flashlight device .
prepare to mount the laser sight onto the rail on the wang .
you have two screw that attach the sight to the wang .
tighten these screw securely .
flip the switch and adjust you laser sight accord to the direction in the owner manual that come with the laser sight .
I have a 3 week old baby budgie and I notice that he / she mother do not stay with he in the nest at night .
I have to mention that i recently separate the father into another cage close to the ' nest cage ' because he and the mother be fight .
he be so eager to go in the nest and feed the baby and she always would go right away in the nest after he and give he a fight right there , were the baby be too .
I think it be dangerous for the baby so I move he .
she feed well the baby on she own , the baby be ok but she do not go in the nest to stay with he at night ...
what be the problem ?
be this a transitional period for the baby ... that he / she be leave alone much more time ?
I have to say that the baby do not scream after she or anything ... he / she sleep .
budgie be breast feed bird and it may be the male be bisexual .
when the male get he titt out the female get mad with he know he can not produce milk .
it be fine - just make sure that the room the cage be in be keep warm .
if the baby be feathered yet - which I be sure he be mostly - he should be fine .
just remember to make sure the mother be properly care for the baby .
ignore the answer above I , btw ! ^_^
can I text from Canada to the united states ?
ok maybe that be not the right question , but my question be can you text from a united states number when you be in canada , can you send text to another united states number ?
and do you get charge for it ?
I be sorry if I could not say the question right .
I hope somebody understand what I mean
in short yes .
however not in all case .
if you ( US ) provider have a deal with a canadian wireless company , you text and call will go through .
they will , however , cost a bunch .
the only way to know for sure be to call 611 , or you cell phone help line , and ask .
the phone and network be compatible , so the only reason it would not work would be if you have , say , a cheap cell phone company ..
yes you can , but it will cost you lot of money unless you have a international plan .
ye$ you can text in CANADA to the U$ on a U$ number .
this service will cost .
it varie$ company to company .
you may want to get a temporary phone for you trip to Canada .
be there any other way to communicate or do you friend only understand text .
sometimes it be hard to explain that you be make a international call and all of the phone companies involve want some of you money .
hope you unde$tood the me$$age I do have a " s " key on my computer .

be Fujairah a nice place to live in ?
my family and I be plan to shift to Fujairah in a couple of year .
so I just need to know if it be a suitable place to live in and in what way .
I would be happy if someone help , especially someone who have be to Fujairah or live there . :)
I live there !
... I have be live in Fujairah my entire life and I must say that it be develop in a good way .
I think 2012 be go to be a great year for Fujairah as we have a lot of project to be do by 2012 .
thing to do in Fujairah ..
it be between sea and mountain so you can camp on beach or between mountain !
... fishing , jet sky , snorkeling , diving be some of the thing you can do for fun .
and now they be finish a road between Fujairah and Dubai in 45 minute only !
so , no it be not as good as Dubai , but it be quieter and more peaceful , and you can still go to Dubai in 45 min .
please let I know if you need anything else
visit Fujairah when in Dubai .
nothing like Dubai , and never will be !
do not know the economics of Fujairah but Dubai be basically bankrupt so you would not want to end up like they !
unless you have a particular skill they need - and firm job offer before go - I would think twice about it !
be there any new gaming console ?
I do not know should i buy PS3 or X - BOX Kinect .
I be a little afraid when i buy ps3 or X - BOX then a newer version come out .
( same for N - DS and PSP )
Wii U have be announce as well as the PS4 however the ps4 be only in development while the Wii U should be out next year .
Microsoft have not announce there new console yet though it be believe to be in the work .
no matter when you buy you will get a newer version .
I feel X - BOX be a very smooth system i own it like 3 year , it be very compatible to previous version and mostly important i be very comfortable with the user interface and the joystick .... cause you do not want to hold a joystick that give you discomfort .
XBOX Joys be soo comfyy .....
performance - you get the same in all , just get a good tv .
I do not know about the playstation situation but I do know that Microsoft have say they do not see the xbox 360 as be even halfway through its lifetime .
since they release kinect this be kind of they way of release a new Xbox so they do not plan on make another one for a while .
what be the typical lifespan of a cat ?
my cat have a seizure yesterday and be ill .
I do a internet search to ascertain how long cat can live , however different source give wildly different lifespan .
my cat be 18 year old .
in you experience how long do cat do cat typically live ?
be he on he last leg or be it conceivable that he could be around for another 15 year as be claim by some of the source i have be look at ?
from my experience with my cat 13 - 18 year depend on the breed .
at 18 year , you cat have have a long life .
indoor cat that be well care for typically live 11 - 15 year .
older male often tend to have urinary tract issue , so you cat have do very well .
male cat very seldom live past 14 - 15 year .
story of cat live more than 25 year be rare .
I have have cat for 35 year and the oldest cat I have ever have be a 23 year old female and she be exceptional .
by comparison , outdoor cat have a life expectancy of 3 - 7 year depend on how many predator be in the local environment .
accord to a couple source , the world record for the oldest cat be a cat in Devon , England who reportedly live to the age of 36 .
I know a cat that die in its sleep aged 21 .
anything after 12 be a bonus .
gain and loose my cockatiel 's trust ... ?
I think that I have gain my cockatiel 's trust , but now he be not come to I when I open he cage .
what do I do ?
do anything happen before lose he trust ?
bird be hard to gain trust with , but it be lose so easily !
a simple hand gesture could have resort to he be afraid of you .
eat by he cage and keep a " sleep cage " in you room be a good idea .
bird eat and sleep with they flock , not predator .
keep he cage open and go on you computer , or read a book , etc and maybe he will come out to you .
let he go at he own pace , do not rush with he , and never ever resort to physical violence with you bird .
this will ruin you bond , and you probably will not have another chance to build one .
patience be the key . =)
he might never be a cuddly , loving , tame bird , but you can still have a friendly bond .
but then again he could be !
that bird be smart .
like my dog , they really like I and trust I , but when I open the door to get they outside , they run from I , they know I be go to take they outside and they do not like it .
the bird must know that when you open the cage door it mean that you will put he in the cage , and bird do not usually like cage .
so , I do not think the bird do not trust you , but still do not like the cage .

how can i get my kitten to stop bite when he play ?
I have a kitten who just turn 3 month today .
he be a good kitty , just when he play he bite really hard .
almost every day he would even wake I up like 5 am in the morning , try to bite my arm .
and when I move it I guess he figure I be play . x.x
I read somewhere that you have to hold he mouth together , and keep it that way til he panic .
that seem cruel to I though .
any other way ??
do you think he be teethe ?
it be get out of hand .
yeah , I think that the holding he mouth thing sound wrong .
no worry , i do not try .
he do have toy , a scratching post , lot of mouse , ball , yarn , a feathery birdy toy , etc .
he would just randomly walk up to you and start the biting .
when i put he off of my bed , he jump back on and same thing .
he may be teethe but i do not think it can be stop .
yes do not hold any animal 's mouth shut it will close they air way , he be just a kitty and they be very rambunctious , get he toy .
which rat cage be better ?
hi , I want to get a few pet rat and need a rat cage .
( apart from the wire flooring which i be go to cover ) which of these two cage be better :
I can not decide between height or width .
this one be better for rat .
you always want to go higher rather than wider for rat .
they love to climb .
you will have to cover the wire flooring like you say , and make fleece cover for the stair , so no ratty foot get catch and break .
this cage will hold about 2 - 3 rat .
both be equal length so go for the taller one .
if you use this cage it be best to remove the wire shelf altogether and replace it with hammock and the like .
I use one of these cage short term for a pet and it be not that great to be honest , pretty cheaply make , the door spring be annoying and it do not last very well .
here be some better option imo :
the first one be much better !
I have this exact cage , buy from the exact Ebay user .
it be really good and the Rat calculater say be big enough for 5 rat , but I would put a maximum of 4 in it really :)
be under tank heating or side tank heating better for a corn snake ?
i be read the package for a tank heater i buy for my 40 gallon tank for my snake and it say it can be put under the tank or on the side .
i be not worried about damage the surface my tank be on because i can prop it up off the surface anyway .
from my understanding , if it be heat from the bottom , my snake risk burn its belly if it burrow and rest directly on top of the glass over the heater unless i buy some of that reptile carpet to put under the substrate , but it have better heat distribution
if it be from the side i do not have to worry about prop it up , but the snake can still burn itself if it slither along the side of the tank and i also read that it do not distribute heat as well ?
what be you suggestion and opinon ?
i use uth' on all of my burrow snake .
they will move if they get too warm - it be not like a heat rock which you should avoid at all cost .
i usually put my own natural rock over the uth and they be perfectly fine .
i have over 40 corn , king , and milk and have never have a problem with the uth system .
on the side be a waste - leave it on the bottom .
good luck !
bottom if you be worried about the snake burn itself put something over it like newspaper ...
I now use a 75 watt basking or heat bulb for mine and he seem to like it
put the heater on the snake he will love it and the the next day you will have dinner

question about the sinking of the Titanic ?
after the sinking of the Titanic in 1912 , be there a law make so that ship would carry enough lifeboat to save everybody on a ship if it be sink ?
sorry , I be just very nervous after watch the movie .
SOLAS ( Safety of Life at Sea ) , which be a international maritime treaty , come about in response to the tragedy of the Titanic .
today , it be the primary safety law affect virtually all ship , regardless of country of registration .
most ship perform this drill before even leave the dock .
SOLAS cover just about every aspect of safety at sea , include minimum safety equipment , practice , and standard , lifeboat , navigation practice , fire protection , and so on .
we be much safer today on board ship due to SOLAS , and I suppose if any good come out of the Titanic tragedy , the adoption of SOLAS be probably it .
edit : also I forget to mention earlier , most ( if not all ) cruise ship also practice lifeboat drill weekly , and it be not uncommon to see they to actually launch the lifeboat into the water as part of they drill when you be in port .
this not only ensure the lifeboat be operational and will work if need , but make the crew proficient at launch they .
I do not think so
do not worry .
when be the last time you hear about a ship sink ?
100 year ago ?
what be some fun thing I could do while in Japan ?
I will be in Okinawa for about a week so I be wonder what be some fun thing I could do ?
how be the night life in Naha ?
be there any good venue that showcase underground band , or just a venue at all ?
it do not have to be underground it could be any type of music .
the best thing you can do in Okinawa be to go to a beach .
otherwise , you can do what you can do in other part of Japan , like shopping , eating , etc .
or you can visit temple or shrine in Okinawa .
well first you can try speak Japanese .
go to a sumo tournament .
eat at a conveyor - belt sushi restaurant .
climb Mount Fuji .
Okinawa be quite different from the rest of Japan , although of course there be similarity .
the main thing people do there be go to the beach .
there be the market in Naha , which be great .
you can find all sort of fresh food and get a really delicious , fresh sashimi / sushi lunch upstairs .
try the local sake too if you can .
it be a special kind .
I be not sure that there be much nightlife in Naha .
it be more of a place to go to enjoy the weather , the sea , etc .
you might have to make you own nightlife by find a izakaya ( pub ) somewhere .
you best bet would probably be to get a copy of the Lonely Planet Japan book and read the chapter on Okinawa .
Naha be not a very big city .
modern m 16 versus Vietnam m 16 version ?
I be play a video game that have a m 16 Vietnam model , and in the game it be 3 - shot burst .
my brother say they only have full - auto and semiautomatic during Vietnam .
my question be ..
to save money Robert McNamara order that the ammunition for the new m - 16 be send to sea in the early 60 use a older ( dirtier ) type of gunpowder mean for use with the m - 14 .
he also order that the receiver not get a ( I think chrome ) coating that help keep the gun from jam .
than the troops be issue the weapon be tell it be self - clean , which it be not .
as a result there be a problem with the weapon jam .
once the troops start clean the weapon properly ( even with the dirtier powder ) the Vietnam era m - 16 turn out to be a good weapon for the purpose it be be use for .
the screw - up be the kind of thing you have happen when you have bean - counter ( and McNamara be nothing if not a bean - counter ) instead of soldier in charge of the military .
today 's weapon do not have that kind of problem , and be much more reliable .
Vietnam m 16 use to clog up and never work .
no one use 3 burst .
you play too much cod ;p
modern m 16 be best
plan on go to New Zealand in January .
be it ok to holiday in Christchurch since the earthquake ?
be the hotel back up and run ?
be there still aftershock ?
plan on go to North and South Island .
be it safe to go to Rotarua , since the earthquake ?
Rotorua be fine .
I be assume this be in reference to the January earthquake , do not worry , it be very deep , so nothing be effect :)
as for Christchurch , yes the aftershock be still happen , but these be fairly small - you can feel they , but the do not do any damage .
since lot of people be still live there , then it must be fine to visit .
however the CBD be close of to the public as a lot of it be still rubble and stuff and have not be clear away yet .
I be sure that you can find some hotel that be run in the christchurch area , but if not then there would be some in close by town .
despite the aftershock I would recommend go to Christchurch , just for the experience and then you can see first hand how thing get effect by earthquake .
have fun in New Zealand !!
( ps. I be assume you will stop off in Wellington , and since it be summer , may I recommend kaffee eis ice creams and gelatos ?
just recently discover they last time I be down there , they be very nice ) www.kaffeeeis.co.nz
load of place have geographical hazard , if you be constantly paranoid , you will never get anywhere without a sense of adventure .
in case of a earthquake , stay under a sturdy table and do not go outside as possible debris will fall .
yes it be ok .
yes , yes and yes .
nothing wrong with rotorua
what size horse do i need ?
I would say it really depend on you riding ability , what discipline you be interested in do , or plan on do , etc .
but I would go for the base number of 15 hh .
it be " tall " be it be bigger than a pony , but it be on the small end for a horse .
I get my horse when I be 12 and I be already 5 ' 9 - 5 ' 10 , thankfully I stop grow when I hit 5 ' 11 " but my horse be about 16.2 or 16.3 hh , TB .
so do not be afraid to get something a little bigger than " perfect " just in case you hit a growth spurt .
a taller horse do not always mean a horse you can not handle .
keep that in mind .
you just want to be sure you can groom and saddle sufficiently and the horse itself be calm enough so that whatever size it be , you can handle it .
i be 5 ' 3 - 4 " and be 21 well will be in Nov and my horse be 14.2 hh and she be perfect size for I i can hop right on with no mounting block ..... only with a saddle though haha i can not bareback , not yet
if you do not want to grow out of it quickly get a 14 ' 2 ..
anything smaller you will grow out , anything bigger will be too big and difficult to control and manage , especially when ride .
hope I help :)
where in the world be Iguazu ?
the centre of the falls be know locally as ' Garganta Del Diablo ' ( the Devil 's Throat ) , where the huge volume of water send a constant mist of spray into the air .
with the sun shin down on the spray , create a rainbow in the foreground , this be the perfect place to get that trademark Iguazu Falls photograph .
however , save some of you shot for the rest of the fall , as in total there be around 270 cascade that spread out over nearly 2 mile of the Iguazu River .
the Iguazu Falls be easily accessible and , dependent on you time restriction and budget , you can get to the area by either bus or plane .
the nearest town to the site be Puerto Iguazu in Argentina , about 12 mile from the falls , and Foz do Iguaçu in Brazil , which be equally close .
both town have airport that be serve regularly from the larger city such as Sao Paulo , Rio de Janeiro and Buenos Aires .
the bus be obviously the cheaper option , and travel up from Buenos Aires the trip be a full 20 hour , although the bus be very comfortable with spacious recline seat .
the bus trip down from Sao Paulo be a similar affair take around 18 hour .
Foz on the brazilian side be the larger town , however both be gear up to cater for visitor to the waterfall and national park , and so offer a range of accommodation for all budget .
for those with a larger appetite for the scenery and a larger budget , there be some hotel complex much closer to the action with view of part of the fall .
Paris or England while study aboard ?
where would you go ?
I have never be anywhere out side my home town Charlotte north Carolina please help !!!!
definitely London -
you speak the language and will have more fun .
the french tend to look down on the Americans and treat they bad .
London be a deliteful city to visit and easy to get around .
you will be able to have a good time there .
as you be from the States you will have much more fun in London .
Parisians dislike Americans for they lack of speak French and proper french manners .
I be tell to leave a restaurant because I order water with my meal ( apparently this be " wash down " you food " ) and not order wine .
you will need to have intermediate French to have a good time in Paris .
however , outside Paris everybody be wonderful .
nobody like the Parisians , even the Parisians do not like Parisians .
South France be wonderful , right on the Mediterranean .
it be beautiful and the people be extremely friendly .
I use to live in London for 6 month and it be by far one of my favorite place to be in the world ( I have be to 45 country in 5 year ) .
everything about the place be magical and the people be mostly friendly .
however , if you be allow another option and you want a small - town feel , then head to Edinburgh , Scotland .
I live there for 8 month .
I also highly recommend stay with a french family .
I do this at age 13 in Champagne , France and it be the most amazing experice of my upbringing .

how can i make my jack dempsey reproduce ?
he be the issue , you be try to " make " they mate .
this be like try to make 2 people get marry .
it do not work .
first you need a compatible pair .
sound like you 2 at least tolerate each other , so there be hope there .

then the environment .
large tank , no annoying tankmate , perfect water conditon and really good feeding .
get that right , and they will mate when they be ready .
you can not make they mate , you can only encourage they .
most of the time one be more interested in breed than the other .
bredder take the one that in not very interested and put it alone in a breeeding tank for 3 - 5 day .
the tank should have a hide space big enough for one fish , or a few of they , but at least 1 cave big enough for two fish to fit in .
the p h should be 6.5 - 7 .
then add the other mate .
they may not respond right away and they may fight so the smaller one can fit in one of hide space if it get attack .
when the male 's aggressive behavior stop , it be ready to spawn .
the two lay they egg inside the cave you make for they .
turn the water temp up to 82 degree
please help with my cat 's bladder issue ?
I have a 1 1 / 2 year old female calico .

first of all , I be very sorry to hear you be have this issue with you cat . :(
frequent urination be a sign of several thing .
bladder or urinary tract infection be two common one , but these usually be frequent visit , with small amount of urine be pass .
give the chance you cat may only have one kidney , I would think the worst case scenario would be kidney disease , which untreated can lead to possible renal failure .
sign of this can be hard to spot , and if this be true in she case she will definitely need to see a vet .
vomiting , bad breath , and listlessness .
seizure will occur when the toxin that the kidney normally filter out be release into the blood stream .
I know you be very worried , but get she to the vet be the best thing you can do for she .
in the meantime make sure she have plenty of water available to she .

1 ) the Italian Renaissance begin the opening phase of the Renaissance , a period of great cultural change and achievement in Europe that span the period from the end of the 13th century to about 1600 , mark the transition between medieval and early modern Europe .
the term renaissance be in essence a modern one that come into currency in the 19th century , in the work of historian such as Jacob Burckhardt .
although the origin of a movement that be confine largely to the literate culture of intellectual endeavor and patronage can be trace to the earlier part of the 14th century , many aspect of italian culture and society remain largely medieval ; the Renaissance do not come into full swing until the end of the century .
the word renaissance ( Rinascimento in Italian ) mean " rebirth " , and the era be best know for the renew interest in the culture of classical antiquity after the period that Renaissance humanist label the Dark Ages .
these change , while significant , be concentrate in the elite , and for the vast majority of the population life be little change from the Middle Ages .

I be american and I be go to the UK for the first time , what should I expect ?
I just need to talk to a another american who have go to the UK before so that I know what expect when arrive at the airport and with go through visa process and everything .
do you get you visitor 's visa immediately at the airport ?
I be tell that americans automatically get a six month visitor 's visa .
do you have to go through a medical exam right away ?
drug test ?
blood test ?
i have talk to some people that say that a medical exam be a invasion of privacy and other say it be a routine thing when enter another country .
I honestly have no idea what to expect or prepare for and call in to get professional advice from either of the embassy cost by the minute - which I really do not have the money for .
I be really worried cause I have no idea who to talk to and want everything to go smoothly .
a american passport should get you right into the country , there be no need for a visa , for six month .
there be no medical exam or blood test or other like that .
you do not need to call the embassy to get professional advice .
above be the link to the Department of State travel website , which will give you all the info that you need , include passport information .
it be free .
I never stay more than two week at a time when I visit the U.K .
you should be fine with just a passport , unless you be stay longer than six month .
you should double check with the necessary embassy before you leave though .
I be not sure how well you plan this trip .
you will have a great time , so no worry there .
I visit London , Edinburgh , and St. Andrew 's so far , and I be treat very well and with great kindness .
just treat everyone else as you would want to be treat , and you will be fine .
that tactic never fail I .
what would you get if you cross a sussex male and a silkie female ?
i have a sussex male and a pekin female i buy 2 silky what would the sussex female and the silkie female would make ?
if you have any pic of you hen i would like to see they to compare they to mine thanks ?
a sussex cross with silkie would make a crossbreed * mutt * chicken .
there be a lot of genetics at play between a sussex and silkie , so the offspring would vary in appearance .
however , I can say what feature they would / could have .
feather type .
silky have hookless feather .
sussex have soft feather .
all offspring from this cross will have soft feather , as hookless feather be a recessive gene .
skin Color : silky have black skin color , which be dominate .
sussex have white skin which could be recessive or dominate .
either way rec. and dom. white gene dilute the black gene .
skin will be darker but lighter than the silky .
beard / muff : if you silkie have a beard / muff the offspring could have a beard as well , as these gene be incomplete dominate .
feathered foot / shank - chick could have feathered foot / shank as this be also incomplete dominate .
crest : chick could also develop a small crest due to this be another incomplete dominate gene .
comb type : silky have walnut comb which be actually genetically two comb type ( rose and pea ) single be also there , but be recessive .
so cross to a Sussex you could get a walnut , pea , rose , or single comb bird .
five toe : silky have five toe .
sussex have four toe .
cross together ( five toe be incompletely dominate ) chick could develop to have a fifth toe on both , or even one foot .
silkie cross be great bird , and very neat look .
hen make excellent mother as they be bigger , can see better , and be smarter than silky .
best wish ,
Jamie / RhodeRunner
I take some photo of my model girlfriend with my Nikon d7000 .
what do you think of these photo ?
what do you think of these photo ?
the lighting be not the best , but the pic turn out ok in my opinion .
delete a question where you do not like the answer will not get you better answer ... i refer to my previous answer :
you need to learn about white balance , composition , angle , and work on use the camera properly ...
[ edit - and she must be very new to modeling , because she do look unsure of she pose )
lol , he have post this so many time today already .
clearly he be mad that people know he take she pic off the net and it be not he gf
not bad , but too many distracting element for my taste .
for example :
in the photo on the couch , the pillow she be rest on clash with everything else in the shot .
there be also some distracting background element like the light fixture and what look like a door handle on the left .
in the standing photo ( from the front ) there be a corner of a rug creep in , some kind of box in the lower right corner and what look like a power cord .
in the shot from the back , the crumple bottom of the curtain be pretty noticeable as well as the power outlet .
compositionally , this one be not my favorite , I would suggest try a different crop because I do not think cut she off at the calf look great .
I do like the shadow , though .
use a fairly wide aperture be also helpful in blur out unwanted background element .
what be some unique custom in ireland ?
as far as I be aware we most unique custom would be the " country wake " .
in all my travels I have never see anything like it and be often meet with a odd look when I explain they to foreigner .
in this time visitor will come to the house , pay they respects to the desisted and they family and have a couple of cup of tea with a sandwich or a bun .
the wake also include the night sit were friend and family sit up through the night with the remains .
wake be common both north and south of the boarder with Protestants and Catholics alike .
but only really in the countryside .
the only notable difference I have notice be that in the south of Ireland one night of the wake be often hold in the chapel the night before the funeral , this tradition start after the civil war .
another unique custom ( and a die one at that ) be the Pioneers .
I my self be one but appreciate that the organization be unlikely to make into the 22nd century .
the Orange Order and the 12th of July Marches would be argue by some not to be a irish custom but unarguable tick every criteria to be consider one .
the march on the 12th of July be only really attend by protestants in the Ulster but in spite of the be the largest attend paraded in Ireland .
barn brack and the ring .
the irish custom we have in we family be ; we make sinnel cake for easter , barn brack and col - cannon for Halloween .
christmas cake for christmas day .
do animal see image on a tv screen like human do ?
do animal see image on a tv screen like human do ?
I be unsure of this , because once I watch a commercial of cat food with my cat and she do not react to see another cat on tv .
as far as I understand , this ad will get dogs excited , but my question be : can dog actually see the image feature in the advert like human ?
also , can animal remember image on tv like we , human ?
I would not know -- I do not particularly like scary movie , and I have not try this with my pet .
although , I do not think that scary movie will affect pet for a long time ; I be sure they will forget sometime -- or be I wrong ?
do dog enjoy watch t.v. ?
well , t.v. be a series of flicker picture that be stream together to make a move picture .
the picture be broadcast at a rate of about 60 hz , which be how fast they need to move for we to see they as a move , flawless picture .
to a dog , watch t.v. be a lot like watch a old scratchy silent film because they flicker fusion seem to occur at a rate of 70 to 80 hz .
so they see the picture flicker slower and there for it seem choppy to they .
so chance be that if you dog like to watch t.v. , it be probably because of the sound .
hear be a dog 's secondary sense , and I will discuss that in another blog entery .
yes they do .
i be pretty sure that they do see thing on the tv screen because my cat chase thing around the tv screen
how much should I be look at for horse transportation ?
I need one horse transport to show throughout the 2012 show season , and the location be about 3 hour away from where I live .
the place where I be board be not likely to want to take I this far , and I do not have any way of haul he myself .
so I want to hire someone ( or multiple people ) to transport I to these show .
if they ask how much I be willing to pay , what be a good price range ?
I see a site that charge $ 0.70 per mile .
be that reasonable ?
remember that you get what you pay for .
three hour be not far , but you be do multiple show .
some people be willing to take you horse , but they really have old trailer that be not the safest in the world .
rust , tear corner in the stall , unhealthy air , straight load instead of slant load can all make travel hard , if not downright dangerous , on you horse .
I have my horse transport from CA to WA and he come on this big , open stock trailer .
he be dehydrated when he get there and lose weight .
all horse I have have deliver to I since then be happy and healthy when they arrive .
I would call Bob Hubbard Transport and get a quote .
even though you may not want to use they , it will give you some idea of what it might cost and what be fair .
see link below .
make sure the trailer service you use be bond / insure and know something about first aid .
do they have this anywhere ?
I want to take a cruise around the world .
I mean literally around the world if possible .
second be there any way to sort of customize the place you want to go to ?
like you can pick the destination ?
1 . here be a site that list world cruise include price .
price list , however , be usually base on two people in a cabin , and you will likely face some high " single supplement " cost in addition .
( two people in a cabin will spend more onboard , so cruise line charge you more to sail alone .
you may be able to do better on the rate if you request competitive quote via CruiseCompete ) .
2 . short of charter you own ship and crew , I do not see any way you could customize you own itinerary .
good luck !
various world cruise from most of the major cruise line , typically 100 day in duration .
travel on you own you would have to pay double as cabin be sell on the basis of double occupancy .
no possibility to customise port of call .
prearrange about 18 month in advance as the cruise line sell segment all along the way i.e transatlantic to London ( England ) , England to Barcelona ( Spain ) , Barcelona to Alexandria ( Egypt ) , Egypt to India via Suez canal etc .
yes there be multiple around the world cruise , mainly offer by the more upscale line .
however : you will pay as if there be 2 people in the cabin , even if it be just you .
so any price you find , double it figure , $ 40 k at least .
and no you can not customize a itinerary unless you book several different leg of a cruise with stop in between on shore .. say book a Panamal Canal crossing , then fly to Asia and pick it up again and sail to India then fly to Europe to sail the Med before fly to England to hit the transatlantic corssing .
be the San Francisco Bay Area mostly caucasian back in the early 1970 ?
there have be a large asian presence in the SF Bay Area for a long time -- the Chinatown here be the largest population of chinese outside of China , there be lot of japanese who have be displace during WWII .
the whole Western Addition and a large portion of the Haight be black .
the Mission be basically latin - american .
as the southeast asians and philipinos come over , they add to the culture .
Marin County be predominantly caucasian and many of the expand outer east bay area start out as white suburb .
it be not so long after civil rights law against discrimination start to have a impact .
you never see black MUNI driver , asian police , latino politician until then .
it be a evolution .
many illegal be not count in the population until the mid-80 .
we do not have big percent of chinese migration until the mid 90 .
we have fewer people run across the mexican border then .
we have fewer social benefit at that time for people so many immigrant be not count .
only Caucasians have any political power , corporate presence or own business except for mom and pop store in some neighborhood .
San Francisco be settle in the 19th and 20th century by mainly european immigrant except for some asian worker who be manual laborer .
there have always be a mexican - american cultural influence since Calif be own by Mexico .
San Francisco be always progressive and welcoming and tolerant to all kind of people historically .
the county outside San Francisco be more white than San Francisco in the 70 .
edit : my memory may not be good so you might get a more accurate answer from someone else who remember the time .
can rabbit and chicken live together ?
I be think about get a rabbit as a pet , but my parent say that it have to stay outside .
we also own two chicken that be keep in a run behind our garage / barn thing .
there be already a little dog house that I would turn into a little rabbit hutch be keep back there and I be think about keep the rabbit in the run with the chicken , but keep the chicken in the coop and the rabbit in the hutch at night .
however , in the day time would it be okay for the rabbit to hop around along with the chicken ?
we feed the chicken scrap of veggy and fruit throughout the day , but it be nothing that a rabbit would not be able to digest just fine .
so , can rabbit and chicken live together as long as they have separate place for they food and water ?
my last rabbit do that a few time , and he be fine ...
I just want to make sure :) thank !
yes , but be sure that you chicken be all hen ( I mean not rooster ) , rooster may attack rabbit or anything they see move , so be aware of that , hen be friendly with almost all kind of pet !
from my experience hen ( not rooster ) be very friendly with duck , guinea pig , kitten , cow , rabbit , etc .
be sure not to feed you rabbit non-veg item !
you say they live in different cage and they be free in day , so no problem , do not put both of they in one cage because rabbit bedding be different than that of hen , wet bedding can cause disease in they !
so , do not put both of they in one cage .
good luck !
yea i guess but rabbit can easily escape a pen or another rabbit could get in there and that rabbit could be the opposite gender .
so be very careful and some feed could be toxic to rabbit and safe for chicken .
rabbit do burrow also so do not be surprised if chicken be fall into hole .
rabbit be delicate and can get disease so watch out for that .
melt brass do not work ?
my friend and I be try to melt bras to make some little figure .
we have make a furnace as such , we take a clay flower pot with a hole in the bottom put a piece of steel pipe in the middle of it with a cap on the bottom , fill the pipe with brass scrap , suround the pipe with charcoal light it off and pump air through the hole in the pot , everything get red hot but do not melt .
what be I do wrong
I would recommend to start with something more simple like tin , pewter , aluminum or zinc , they all have a much more reasonable melting point .
I will just echo both other answer .
molten brass be damn hot and usually it be pressurize gas and force air or oxygen .
even if you do melt it , I doubt you foresee the issue of handle it and pour it .
it be really too advanced for a beginner , both in tooling and safety .
just the zinc fume will get you , if you do not take precaution .
pewter be perfect for what you be do , and it melt on a stove top .
I would recommend to start with something more simple like tin , pewter , aluminum or zinc , they all have a much more reasonable melting point .
brass have a even higher melting point than bronze and I would think you charcoal just do not get hot enough .
I have melt small amount of bronze in a crucible with a large propane torch ( much larger than the plumber torch , but it can be run of those propane cylinder you can buy for a gas grill ) .
I melt brass and cast it http://www.mikegigi.com/castgobl.htm
brass melt at just under 2000 F which be a bright yellow heat , not red hot .
you might be able to make a version of you setup work , but it would take quite a bit of charcoal and a lot of force air .
I use propane with a blower and a burner I build http://www.mikegigi.com/meltmetl.htm and http://www.mikegigi.com/firehole.htm
should all UK town and they cafe or restaurant provide halal food ?
some friend of mine visit Dartmouth in Devon whilst on holiday last summer .
they could not find any cafe or food shop that provide halal prepare food .
it be important to they religion that they only consume halal food .
even if you buy a cake in a baker 's you can not be too what happen in the kitchen , for example the cake may have be slice use a knife use for prepare ham .
it be simply not just a case of avoid pork , alcohol and only be allow to eat halal prepare meat , but the kitchen and its utensil should not have be use for prohibit food .
place like Dartmouth be suppose to be tourist town and should provide food for people of all religion .
we all enjoy buy a snack when visit a town or attraction while on holiday .
not everyone want to bring pack lunch .
it be not fair if some people have to go without buy food because no place will provide suitable food for they .
I think it be only fair that nowadays every town should provide at least one halal cafe or restaurant and hopefully one day every british catering establishment will be halal .
when I go to Bosnia , all the meat be halal .
I will not eat halal meat , so guess what , I opt for food which be not a meat dish , there be plenty of other option .
I could not go to they country and demand they slaughter and sell a animal as meat the way I prefer to eat it .
when you go to another country , you live by they way of life and they law , if you do not like it , you know how to get back out the country ( but I guess we benefit system be too much to throw away , huh ) .
to prevent animal cruelty , many country forbid halal and kosher meat .
Switzerland be one , and the Netherlands be pass the same law .
it will become EU law in a couple of year .
we can not dictate what business want to open where .
if someone think there be a business opportunity then they will start open halal only place .
how to convince my parent to let I get a ball python ?
they do not know anything about ball python .
when I ask my mom she say she will never let a snake in she house .
she have no experience with snake and have never hold one .
I do all my research and be well prepare to keep one , I be 14 by the way
lay some knowledge on they dude .
maybe if they see how much time and effort you have devote to research the animal they will reconsider .
tell they it cost like 8 dollar a month ( if even that much ) to keep it fed .
be helpful around the house to show that even if you can not pay for it yourself that you be willing to work for it .
once you have butter they up a bit try to get they to the pet store and ask one of the employee to handle the snake show you mom how gentle and harmless they can be .
maybe even try to get you mom to hold it a bit .
my wife be terrified of snake when we first meet , I introduce she to one out my baby corn snake and she fall in love with it .
be persistent , but do not pester they about it cause that will get you nowhere fast .
good luck !
my general convince you parent to let you get a reptile advice :
1 . be responsible .
do all you chore without be nag , take care of any exist pet , keep you room clean , and so on .
prove , to you parent 's satisfaction , that you , not they , will be the one actually take care of you new pet .
2 . save up , and research , so that you be ready for you new pet .
3 . bargain with they .
offer to do extra chore , ask for you pet as a reward for good grade , something like that .
4 . play the sympathy card .
if you can find a pet at a shelter , or that a friend need to get rid of because they be move or whatever , you might be able to talk you parent into " give it a good home " where you might not be able to talk they into buy a new pet .
on the fear angle -- talk she into come to the pet store with you .
once you be there , ask if you can hold a ball python .
once you be hold it , try to get she to touch / pet it ...
my snake 's meal be too big , what can I do ?
just today I buy a medium rat for my beloved ball python Salazar ( name after Harry Potter ) .
last time I get a medium rat it be a girl and my snake handle she easily .
I really do love my snake cause she be actually a affectionate cold - blood creature .
so my true question come to this , how can I knock the rat out ?
if I throw he against a wall and still conscious he will run away , do I hang he by the tail so the blood can flush into he skull ?
I really do need answer and advice , and not insulting answer !!
like seriously !! >:(
best answer shall receive point :)
i would just stick he in the tank and let you snake have a nice hunt for once , snake jaw detach for this sort of this thing , so why not give she a good hunt , but if you do want he knock he i would just throw he against the wall or something ,, lol i do not know , i agree with you though throw he , haha
ok so if your snake will take pre-killed , you can " gas it " .
just put the rat in a seal tupperware container with no airhole and wait until it pass out and die and then feed it .
if it will not take pre-killed and you usually feed live then you could hold the rat by the tail and whack it against a hard surface , like a refrigerator or wall .
I do not like that option though - I think it be pretty cruel and if not do properly you will end up really hurt the rat but not stun he enough to stop possible injury to you snake .
I would do the tupperwear idea tbh - easiest and most humane .
you could also just wait until the rat pass out for about 1 minute and them feed it - at this point , it could still have a bit of a heart beat and be slightly still alive .
and also maybe try hold the rat in feeding prong so you snake can get a good hold and grip on he prey .
good luck !
just my opinion here - no judgement - get you snake on freeze / thaw will prove to be much easier for you and safer for you snake in the long run .
my opinion - take it for what it be worth . :-)
look to move to Toronto ?
I be a 20 something gay black male and I be look for suggestion on neighborhood close to the downtown Toronto area .
Im move from South Carolina so this will already be a huge culture shock .
any suggestion ?
be gay and live in Toronto be just fine .
you may consider the Gay Village on Church Street , right downtown .
it be full of gay friendly " everything " .
but , you could live where ever you fancy take you .
for obvious reason , know how extremely difficult it be to drive a car in the city , you should probably try to be near the subway system .
but , can you immigrate ?
be a american guarantee you no favour when it come to go to Canada .
start you process here , if you have not already .
( marry a Canadian be not enough - that do not count for at least two year . )
a normal processing time , unless you have a advanced degree or a " specify " skill be from 3 - 5 year .
come to stay , and overstay you three month visit will lead to immediate expulsion and a lifetime ban to immigrate to Canada - not good .
let s be clear about this ...........
just ' want to come to Canada " be not enough .
you must apply , to become a immigrant , and wait to be approve , by the canadian government .
if you have not begin the application process' now < you be about 2 to 3 year away from be approve by Immigration Canada .
so do not pack you bag , yet .
whatever you do ............... do not try to come here with out legal permission .
you will not be able to seek work or take a job , in Canada , with out have to show you Immigration VISA and canadian Social Insurance Number card to any potential employer .
do it properly , and legally , and you will be ok .
how to train my puppy ?
I have a 4 month shih tzu puppy .
recently I be have trouble train he .
he be kind of hate walk with leash , every time I put the leash on , he will try to bite it .
and he be not follow I when I be walk .
I see lot of video about this , but actually it do not help .
be there any way can let he know how to walk with leash ?
he be really excited about anybody he see .
how to prevent this ?
last thing be every time I sit on a chair or something higher than he , he will try to jump on , if he can not , he will bark all the time until I let he get on , what should I do with this ?
anyone have any suggestion ?
thank you very much .
hi , I be a dog trainer for 25 yr .
you need to purchase what be call a shoulder point harness .
this type of harness go around the dog 's chest and leg and have a clip for the leash up on the back of the dog in middle of shoulder blade .
this way , he can not reach the leash to chew it .
when he swivel he head to go for it anyway , tell he sharp " uh uh " gently correct he with a small tug and continue you walk .
do this repeatedly and frequently and he will learn to walk on a leash .
patience be the key here .
he be a young pup and will learn over time and consistency in he training .
and always , always train with love and positive method - never hit or harshly scold .
never train out of fear .
you want you dog to admire you as he pack leader , not fear you .
good luck with you puppy !
all the best .
put he in dog obedience school or call a professional dog trainer . :)
why do not you get some treat that he love and only give he they when he do something right .
or , as i see on embarrassing pet on tv , get a clicker type thing and treat as well .
try to train he to heel , which mean to walk round you before he need to go on a leash , and he may do that .
hey guy .
I be look to visit India with some mate at the beginning of February next year and I be wander what standard of accommodation we could get for rs 500 per person per night .
this would be on a walk - in basis as we want to have the freedom of find a place that look good ( not rely on picture from the internet ) and be in a spot we like .
thanks in advance for share you experience !
sorry , almost forget to ask - would it be cheaper to walk - in to these hotel rather than pre book ?
in Delhi I would recommend Ajay Guesthouse .
travel to Delhi twice and stay there twice .
room start from 500 per double .
those one be quite small .
must say , in Delhi it be hard to get good price / quality rating .
I have find this hotel in the Lonely Planet guide .
it be in a area start with a p , many tourist hotel there and the location be very nice .
but in general , Delhi be the hardest place to find a nice clean hotel for that price .
in Varanasi I do not know .
I have stay in a more expensive hotel there , but you can check some travelguide or tripadvisor ?
also , while travel ask people where they have be and if they have any hotel recommendation .
in Agra I have stay in a place fellow traveller recommend , they find it in the Rough Guide .
it be nice and close to the Taj .
it be quite easy to find something .
( do not stay in Agra too long .
one night be enough ! )
there be many hotel there .
I have pay 500 for a double room there and it be fine and clean .
good luck , enjoy you time !
you may find a normal budget hotel for rs 1000 per night in the city you mention , the link below may help you to find good hotel in Delhi and Agra .
to stay in delhi - Hotel Aster Inn be best to stay in delhi .
it be in karol bagh .
some beautiful location like close to Karol Bagh Shopping Market , Presidential Palace , and Birla Mandir Temple and Connaught Place and Jantar Mantar be near to it .
to stay in Agra - Hotel Atithi and Aditya Palace be perfect for you .
it be centrally situate .
to stay in Varanasi - Sandeep Hotel be you choice ...
which one out of these make the best pet ?
a degu , a rat , a mouse , a hamster or a guinea pig ?
and why be the one a better pet ?
get a guinea pig .
I have a hamster , and mouse and rat like to escape .
the guinea pig be better because it be a lot larger than a hamster , rat , mouse , or degu .
so if you lose he , he be easier to find , because smaller rodent just love to escape from they cage .
so my opinion be guinea pig .
( plus they do not stink that bad )
depend on what you want in a pet , to be honest .
also depend on the space you have , how much time you can handle the pet , how much money you can spend , etc .
I have have experience with all of those pet except degus .
my favorite would have to be the rat .
they be incredibly social , highly trainable , and very clean .
mine learn to " go to the bathroom " only in they cage and love to ride on my shoulder or hang out in my hoodie pouch .
the only downside be they should be keep in pair or trio and require a pretty large habitat .
that mean expense , space , and they require weekly cage cleaning .
again , pair or trio and pretty big living space .
they , too , need weekly cage cleaning and can cost quite a bit .
I could handle my mouse , but they where skittish and prefer they cage .
I have never meet a hamster that do not bite I .
never have / handle a degu .
get a guinea pig .
we have two .
they be social and like to be handle .
you have to have two because they do not do well alone .
make certain you get two female .
two male can fight and you definitely do not want baby !!
guinea pig ( also call cavy ) be gentle creature and be awake during the day and sleep at night .
they will whistle when they hear you as a encouragement for you to give they a treat like leaf lettuce .
they love leaf or romaine lettuce and tomato , celery , cucumber , carrot .
do not feed they broccoli , cauliflower , garlic , onion , head lettuce .... they be all too difficult for they to digest .
also they can not eat potato , they be toxic for they .
if you keep the cage clean they do not smell and you can buy spray on cleaser for they , just massage it into they coat and groom they .
foster 6 week old kitten and hate it !
need advice !?
I want to volunteer and help animal , and decide to try foster kitten .
this be my first experience and I have two six week old kitten right now and be at my wit 's end .
I do not want to have to bring they back before they be eight week old but they be ruin my apartment .
they track poop everywhere ( most disgustingly my bed .... ) , and be constantly try to climb up everything , include my bare leg !
my leg and hand be just full of scratch .
I realize they be young and that cat do climb , but this be just ridiculous .
my apartment also smell repulsive even though I be clean out they litter box at least once a day if not twice .
any suggestion and helpful hint to make this a more positive experience would be extremely appreciate .
that be kind of the way it go .. lol .
limit they to one room with easy to clean flooring .
if you have limit option , try the bathroom .
make sure there be plenty of litter box that be clean often .
depend on the batch of kitten , I will often have as many as one per kitten .
for some reason it take they awhile to learn not to step in poop .
also if they have diarrhea , check in with you foster coordinator .
they may need medication or deworming or something .
they be test out they claw and tooth .
but in the meantime , highly recommend jeans and long sleeve anytime you will be interact with the kitten .
then take care of yourself .
get plenty of sleep and make sure you take time out to do some thing you enjoy .
try visit the kitten a few time a day for short period of time .
try to go in there with the right frame of mind and enjoy they for what they be .
if you still do not enjoy the kitten , see what other opportunity be available .
they may need foster home for adult cat in different situation .. sick , recover from surgery , need a little socialization , etc .
I find the adult be much easier .
generally they be not claw and bite , they do not make nearly as much mess , they do not need nearly as much litterbox scooping , etc :)
decide volunteering be not you thing and give they back !
and do more research before you agree next time ;-)
take the kitten back to the shelter .
what be the requirement to apply for a delay birth certificate in canada ?
what be the evidentary requirement to apply for a delay birth certificate in canada ?
include fee and form
it depend on if you ever register the birth .
some place do the registration right at the hospital .... in some smaller place , you need to register you child 's birth at the town hall / registrar 's office .
my first three child be bear in southern Ontario city .
the birth registration be do right in hospital .
my last son , be bear in northern Ontario ....
I do not know that I do not register he in the ridiculous amount of paperwork I have fill out in the hospital and be suppose to go to city hall within 90 day .
two year later when I get around to fill for he birth certificate , I find out he be never register .
I have to call the Office of the Registrar General in Thunder Bay , have copy of the delayed registration form mail out to I , as they do not have a online area for it yet , fill those out , send they away , then apply for he birth certificate .
if you be just apply for a birth certificate for the first time , it be simple to do it over the computer .
for $ 56 you can even have it expedite and will get in three business day or you money back .
this be in Ontario of course , the rate may be slightly different for other province / territory .
none , just walk in to the service office and present all the identification you have to prove you identity .
they may then choose to ask you to bring more evidence , or just look up the record and hand you the certificate .
you can probably do it all on - line .
start here if you be bear in Ontario .
if you be bear elsewhere , start here .
my parent do not send for my birth certificate until I be 16 and need it for summer employment .
it be no problem to get provide the birth be register in the first place .
I add that in because there have be some people who have try to claim citizenship by send for they birth certificate when they be never really bear in Canada or to canadian parent .
when a child be bear in Canada the birth be register before the baby can leave the hospital .
as long as that be do you can send for it at any time .
each provincial government have a website that list the process for that Province so depend upon where you be bear you can google it .
Royal Caribbean or Carnival cruise ?
only if you have be on board * both * !!
i want to know which you like better and why ?
include which one have :
- better food
- more fun activity
- more teens
- and just more STUFF you like overall
please specify which royal or carnival ship (:
Carnival and Royal Caribbean be two popular cruise line that have strong following .
some cruise aficionado refuse to sail on one or the other .
be there any major difference between they ?
explore which cruise may fit you need the best .
for we comparison we sail on two similar ship - the Carnival Liberty and the Royal Caribbean Mariner of the Seas .
itinerary both ship go to caribbean island like Jamaica , Grand Cayman , Cozumel , St. Thomas , the Bahamas and St. Martin / St. Maarten .
the Liberty also visit its private island Half Moon Cay , Puerto Rico , and Grand Turk .
the Mariner of the Seas travel to its private island Coco Cay and Labadee ( the north coast of Haiti ) .
we love most of the location that both of the ship visit and do not believe that this should be a distinguishing factor on decide between the cruise line .
show each night there be a variety of show .
usually you have the main show and some type of entertainment before and perhaps afterward .
we feel that the main show on the Mariner of the Seas be better .
on the Liberty we like the comedian and juggling act .
if you love see the show , Royal Caribbean be better for the main show and Carnival be slightly better for the comedian .
dining room we enjoy the atmosphere of both dining room on the Liberty and Mariner of the Seas .
we feel that the menu have a little more variety on the Mariner of the Seas .
friendliness of staff the Liberty and Mariner of the Seas both get high grade .
we do have one waiter that complain some on one of we trip on the Mariner .
we have a slightly better experience on the Liberty , but feel that both crew do a excellent job and that this should not be a distinguishing factor on choose a cruise .
pool the Mariner of the Seas and Liberty both have salt water pool - which most cruise ship have .
they both have pool for kid and adult .
we like the Liberty 's pool better because one have a slide .
if you have kid , this would be something that they would definitely enjoy .
spa we try the spa on the Liberty and love it .
we do not try the spa on the Mariner of the Seas .
usually you can not go wrong when get a spa treatment ......
Royal Caribbean be better , but the best cruiseline be Regent Seven Seas .
look on they website rssc.com
Royal Caribbean .
Carnival have be call the WalMart of cruise line ...
what country be the best to travel to ?
I really want to travel when I leave school !
where in the states could I go ?
where in Europe ?
have you every travel before ?
( I have 1 year before collage ! )
& also how much money would I need ?
so I can start save now hehe
I mean when I graduate & yes , college , sorry for the typo .
leave High School ?
in the United States ?
lot of place .
there be 2 more locate outside of the main continent with Alaska way to the north and Hawaii in the Pacific .
big city like New York , Boston , Philadelphia on the East Coast .
beach and Disney of Florida or the mid Atlantic city of Atlanta , Savannah , Charleston .
the federal site of Washington , DC .
southern charm of Nashville , Birmingham , New Orleans or Charlotte .
West Coast hot spot like Seattle , Portland , San Francisco , Los Angeles or San Diego .
just as numerous as the possibility of the US .
do you speak a foreign language ?
I could spend a year in Spain alone .
from Madrid to Seville to Barcelona and Valencia .
Bilboa on the north coast , Pamplona and the very famous Guernica .
a road trip to Lisbon and the Algarve in Portugal before a mountain escape in the Pyrenees and a stop in Andorra before head over to France and Italy and Austria and Switzerland .
I have travel to all of these place and could certainly tailor a trip to you need base on budget , actual time allow , you likes and dislike .
amount of time could be dependent on so many thing .
do you want to see all the site or simply a few photo and on you way to the next place .
do you budget limit you to how long you can stay in each place ?
you need a lot of money for hotel , airfare , see the site , food , local transport - you name it but life cost .
once you have a budget or a amount in the bank then you will be able to figure out where you can go , for how long you can go and what you can do when you be there .
1 year before collage or college ?
good luck .
I recommend buy a single unlimited Europass and travel anywhere in the EU you heart desire .
you can not beat the price for what you get .
come to Africa .
Nigeria , a lovely country .
Obudu cattle ranch .
more than a tourist centre .
how do you make you cat adjust to a new house ?
I and my family be move into a new house just outside a small town .
we be currently live a mile from the town in a house surround by field but the new house be beside a busy road .
we have have the cat for 10 year and do not want to leave it .
how could we make it settle in a new house .
you be not just move house - you cat be lose he territory .
you will need to give he only a small place to explore , so he can make it he territory , and feel safe there .
then , he can have a place to retreat to when he feel scared .
you will need to get he box and bowl , and whatever blanket and toy be he , and smell like home , and put he in a room .
close the door , and keep he in there for a week .
he will feel much safer in that one room , than in a huge unknown house .
he will explore the room , mark everything with he cheek , and try to make it feel like he territory .
he will reassure himself that no other animal be in there , and that no other animal will come in - he be afraid that he be in someone else 's territory when he be in a new house .
in a week 's time , he will have make it he , and will be get more bored than afraid .
let he out for half a hour , to explore .
then put he back in .
he will be freak out , so go back to he territory will make he much happier .
extend the time he be out each day , but for the first month , always put he in he room at night , so he feel safe to sleep .
soon he will make the whole house he , but he need that one safe place to start from .
remember to visit with he while he be in the room , and tell he how good he be .
remember to give he the time he need to feel that the room be he - rush it , and he will be afraid of the whole house for a long time .
he might even start pee on thing in fear .
good luck with you new house and with he new territory !
let she explore when we move my cat have to explore the entire house before she feel comfortable .
in time though she / he will adjust . :)
they just do it on they own .
I just adopt a 2 year old male german shepherd with major bad behavior ?
last night , I adopt a 2 year old male german shepherd .
I will walk outside and he will stand at the door and stare at I or run away .
my other major problem be that he will not get in he crate .
I will get a treat and try to get he in there that way , it will not work .
he will not even get close to the crate .
if I come towards he , he will run away .
how do I train he to feel comfortable in he crate ?
he will not do anything on command .
it be very frustrating .
I have a 9 month old german shepherd that I raise from a puppy .
I train she myself .
she be crate train , potty train , and can sit , lay down , stay , come , fetch , and will even stay in a down position while I throw a treat across the floor or even right next to she paw , and she will not get it until I give she the command .
yes , lot of time and lot of patients ...
I just do not know how to do it with a grow dog .
she toss I around like it be nothing !
... but basically , what I do be the same thing I do with my puppy ... lot of patience , lot of time , lot of praise , lot of treat , and lot of repition .... right ?
be there any trick I could use ?
maybe get a book on training .
you have to be in command at all time .
there be way to get you new dog used to the crate or go out .
I would start with a leash .
put the leash on the dog and just walk around the crate a few time .
then take the leash off and do nothing else but that .
later do it again .
when the dog be ok with this , then open the door and walk around the crate , leave the door open all the time .
put something fun inside .
let you dog go in when he want to for no reason .
do not shut the door .
let he walk in and out for a few day .
at some point he will feel ok with this and you can then close the door but not for long at all .
open the door and let he out and see how he act .
if you push it , it will never work .
with go outside , put the leash on and just take he for a walk .
he will learn to really like this .
potty outside will come at some point .
try obedience class .
have patience with he , you just get he and who know how he be treat before you bring he home .

there be not much to see in the delta , it be a lifestyle not a resort area .
if you be adventurous you can take a bus or water taxi to my Tho ( near where we live ) or Can Tho .
from either of those city , you can venture out and spend a day in the country .
you take a boat across the river , then spend a day bike , eat at a local restaurant , buy souvenir and do other thing that be gear towards tourist .
the countryside be very beautiful , especially if you have a few month ( or year ) to get to know the place .
it be call Kiwi Heaven and it be across the river from Cho Ben Tre .
it be a little hard to get to by foot , they be rebuild the bridge , but you can get someone to moto - taxi you there for a dollar or less .
he be a ex-pat from New Zealand and he be be in town for awhile .
he will set up a real tour of the area for you , not some tourist fantasy .
have a good trip where - ever you end up .
we go with Intrepid as a part of they North to South Vietnam trip , but they do offer this one day separately .
we have a great time and visit a location where they make coconut candy , visit a local restaurant which be attach to a fish farm , ride in modify quad bike and have some tropical food at what appear to be a local hangout .
Intrepid be good at get you away from the most touristy spot and show you something a little different .
yoga and horse ..... ?
I get a riding lesson today on one of my boss 's fino horse and it make I realize just how unsteady my left leg be .
I mention it to my boss and she say to start do yoga .
but there be just so many pose and program !
any good pose or program ( I be willing to buy a dvd as long as it be under $ 20 ) to help specifically with leg stabilization ?
I just have a few issue support my back and my left leg flop .
because I do not feel like spend over $ 20 on a freakin dvd
I also have back problem that transfer into my leg .
here be what I do now and it really help ....
when I first get on I take 1 leg and pull it back up to touch my butt with my heel and hold it there for 1 lap at a walk around a large dressage arena .
then the same thing with the other leg .
then 1 lap at a walk around the arena with both my leg pull out as far as I can , so they be not touch the saddle .
if the weight be go into you heel ( it throw you leg forward ) put the stirrup up against the heel of you boot .
do a nice work trot , not a slow trot .
all this will help you use both leg evenly , keep proper contact and use you wight correctly , to keep you leg in a good position .
btw you do not want you leg lock in place , it will move with the horse a bit .
when I first start do it I would do it every day .
now I just do it once or twice a week or as need .
now not only be my leg better , but my back be relax .
i would not bother with yoga i would practice more with riding and fix my problem , ride bareback , with no iron , there be also a way to ride on you knee ?
that help alot with you thigh muscle ( bareback though )
ya i really would not bother with the yoga
maybe a back brase will help , sometimes my back really get to I and i have think about get one .
I really can not help you .
what to feed my dog after gastroenteritis ?
my dog have be sick for about 3 day now .
he have be have diarheya everywhere and he begin to vomit last night .
I think it would pass until he start to vomit blood and would not drink any water .
I take he to the Animal Hospital and they run blood work and everything come back normal .
no pancreatitis or anything abnormal .
the vet say it be gastroenteritis and give he fluid under he skin , a injection of nausea medication along with some take home antibiotic .
so my question be ..
be it normal for dog to throw up blood while have gastroenteritis ?
and will these antibiotic help ?
I have trye to give he water but he will not take it .. what should i do ?
i do not want he to get dehydrated and also should i try to give he a little bit of food ?
... some help would be great .
thank you :)
they do not take x - ray they offer they but i just could not afford any more treatment .
I feel like shit for say that but after what they have do already i will not be buy grocery for the next few week .
I will give they a call and see what they say .
thank you for the help .
ok so i speak to the vet and he say to give he white rice and boil chicken but only a little at a time .
since he recieve the fluid last night he say not to worry about drink water for at least a couple of day .
I go home at lunch to check on he and he be do 1000 etter he be actually walkin around and wagin he tail :) thanks everbody for the info it be greatly appreciate .
to answer you question in order :
however , if they have be vomit numerous time , then the blood could be due to irritation of the stomach and intestine .
he could also have Parvovirus , a gi foreign body , or any number of thing .
do you vet take radiograph ( x - ray ) ?
it could be due to nausea or any number of thing .
from there you end up with electrolyte imbalance , which can lead to heart and kidney problem .
and be dehydrated , vomit , and have diarrhea just do not feel good .
they should have discuss a bland diet with you , include the frequency of feeding and how much to feed at each sitting .
it sound like you dog may benefit from be hospitalize , and put on iv fluid to help he hydration , administer the antibiotic iv , and to ensure that he start to recover .
you should absolutely call you veterinarian back immediately to clarify anything you have question about .
they have see you pet , and be most aware of he condition .
no one online will be able to assist you more than you vet can .
you need to ask you vet these question .
boil white rice and boil chicken breast .
bland food .
no spice !
my vet tell I when a dog be vomit a lot , it could be a sign of obstruction .
do they do any x - ray ?
I do not know if vomit blood be common with this ailment .
you should call you vet now and ask they what be normal or not .
french dating etiquette ?
I would really love to hear what the french or those who have date the french to say something about this .
I be in my 20' and currently study in France .
come from a anglo - saxon country my version of dating be ' get the number , ask she out , etc. . '
however , I have read on the internet that the french dating etiquette be totally different .
for they , dating would normally be meet in group or party , then pair off .
in addition , from my understanding one - on - one date be something that come much later and not ' straight - away ' like we anglo - saxons .
they be also very secretive about be in a relationship .
they only ' go out in the open ' once they have reach a certain level of seriousness .
be it true ?
I have tell a french girl I like she , and she accept .
she be friendly when we see each other on campus .
she be also nicer when we be both alone .
however , when we be at party or when they be people around she seem to ignore I .
she also seem to hate it whenever I ask she out on a date , to the point she say stop !
my mind think she have no interest in I and just string I along .
but the article I read seem to say the contrary .
have I just fall victim in a cultural trap ?
what you have read in the internet be fairly accurate but of course it do not fit all scenario .
you be not french for a start , so the " rule " or " custom " may not apply to you when it come to enter into a relationship between people from different background .
from what you say the message give by this girl be quite clear .
she be just be friendly in public because she do not want to offend you and she treat you like any other friend .
you say you like she and she accept it as a truth and perhaps as a compliment , but it do not mean she fancy you or want to pair off with you .
at party she do not want to be consider in any way attach to you , which be consistent .
take the message for what they be : she have no objection in you be pal at uni , but she do not want to take matter further .
" non ! " mean " non " , not " I might consider it , and I will keep you attached to my apron string just in case . "
Christiane give you a good answer .
you have fall in a cultural misunderstanding .
what I have to add be that it be normal in France to have mix gender group of friend , there be nothing unusual in boy and girl be only friend , which be obviously what this girl want from you .
she probably find you company pleasing as a friend but you be not she choice of a boyfriend and she be try to keep it on a friendship level , and try to make you understand that she do not want to go further .
if she be nicer when you be alone I would say it be because in public view she be make sure that people do not think that you might be she boyfriend .
unfair for the girl as boy do not have that kind of handicap , but that be the way we own rule work .
should have do research before you leave .
why not just take you chance and do it you way ?
true or false : be a young New Zealander mean have no future ?
there be no job in this country .
I be just try to make up my mind whether I should move to Australia or seek work in the sex industry .
be there a future for we nation 's youth ?
@ Ryan B ,
I be two year into a undergraduate degree .
everybody I know at university intend to stay at uni for as long as possible until there be actually job available .
everybody seem to flee this country and move overseas , to Australia , etc .
there be obviously a reason for that ( lack of employment , low income , etc . )
you answer do not do anything but remind I that I be go to be $ 25,000 in debt by the time I be 22 .
so , thanks .
@ W.a.b.b.y ,
I really like you're answer .
it be very logical .
I have also consider become a teacher , but it be not a job I be cut out for .
I also wish I have apply for a scholarship .
I do not think I would be award one , but I receive the Dux Litterarum award at high school , so my chance be probably better than I think they be .
obviously I be still completely stupid though .
I mean , I be not smart enough to apply for a scholarship .
and yes , I be be melodramatic .
@ Hatmanone ,
* gasp * so I would not make a good prostitute ?
be you say I be bad in bed ?
how would you know ?
you answer be very sweet , but I be not compassionate towards teenage high school student .
a little mellow dramatic ?
yes thing like philosophy and fashion design be interesting , but how many job be out there for someone with these qualification ?
I be study to be a teacher , so I know that there will definitely be job out there when I be done .
I may have to live somewhere rural or in Auckland , but at least I can be pretty sure I will be employable .
I have also get a bachelor 's degree so I can go back and do further study or take a different profession .
and it be not all about how much you earn , cost of living be much higher in many city in Australia .
try live in Sydney on a teacher 's salary , then compare it to somewhere like central Otago .
you also have to put up with all the annoying accent in Australia .
it be probably not a wise idea to keep study and have a massive student loan .
at the moment there be no interest , but that will probably change .
and they will probably add interest to what you have already rack up .
and they be work towards be able to extradite people who have leave the country to avoid pay it back .
at the moment if you move overseas you can only come back to New Zealand for a short amount of time before they will force you cough up .
and all that time you be overseas you will be rack up interest .
I would not like not have the option to return to NZ .
I guess I be extremely fortunate that I receive a scholarship which pay about 800 of my course fee through my degree .
there be far too many lazy people out there who think that they can sit around a job will fall in they lap .
my 2 c. ....
get a education !
I be do fine .
whilst youth job be thin on the ground , do not assume it be better in Oz .
people have be flee this country at roughly a plane load per week for the past 20 + year , so it be not anything new .
it depend on what you hunger for .
700 f job be not advertise .
that mean make yourself know ; that mean networking .
why do my baby king snake refuse to eat ?
i have a baby eastern king snake .
i have try everything i can to get he to eat but he refuse .
he have a great environment , with water and lot of hiding place and a heat lamp .
as far as i know , everything be as good as it can be where he aquarium be concerned .
accord to the vet , he be healthy and look good .
he have be go to the bathroom like he should .
( i know that snake that have problem go to the bathroom will not eat . )
he have be drink water ( i be pretty sure he have be drink it out of he bowl , but also i have be feed he water and he do not ever give I a problem with that - i just stick he head near the water and he suck it down . )
i handle he every few day .
he be feisty , as most king snake be , but he be a very nice little guy - he never try to bite or anything .
i just love he to death .
i do not know why he will not eat though !
i have try feed he 5 or 6 live pinkie and 4 or 5 frozen ( thaw ) pinkie .
i have try put he in a small container and put he in a dark place for a hour or so and he will not touch the pinky .
he crawl on top of they but do not try to eat they .
he do not seem to know that they be food .
i have try " brain " both live and dead pinkie , and bloody they up to get he attention , but he do not care .
i have try dip both live and thaw pinkie in tuna juice , and in used gerbil bedding .
i have buy some long reptile feeding tweezers and have try hold the pinky in front of the snake 's face .
he will not even try to bite .
i be very discouraged and sad and i do not know what to do .
he have not eat in a entire month .
i have only try to feed he one at a time .
he be just a tiny baby , about the width of a pencil .
do baby this small hibernate ?
when you feed he how many pinkie do you feed he ?
if you feed he too many he could just not be hungry .
if he do not seem interested in they at all I would say he be just not hungry .
my boyfriend have one and when she be hungry she attack the pinkie right away .
they can smell it so i be sure he know what it be and just do not want it .
remember snake can go a while without eat .
in the winter , they will usually go deep underground and enter a hibernation - like state call brumation , which be characterize by a slowed metabolism and reduce activity .
king snake sometimes stop eat , particularly during the cooler part of the year .
they have a natural instinct to hibernate .
if the snake be not pregnant or shed , and its enclosure be properly equip , a loss of appetite probably signal a beginning of hibernation .
hibernation be natural , and a necessity for snake that be go to be breed .
another thing that can cause a king snake to stop eat be shedding .
you can tell when you king snake be about to shed , because its eye will get milky look .
its body will be dull look , too .
in a few day the snake will begin to shed its skin .
for example , some snake will routinely go off they food in both the summer and winter , feed mainly in spring and fall .
it be natural and so long as you do not see any serious deterioration in they health be nothing to worry about .
you see , some snake for no obvious reason will simply go off they food .
they be fit and healthy and they care be suitable .
hope this help .
that be why it be good to have a python !
it be twice my size and eat a rabbit once a month .
be my two cat fight or play ?
how rough be too rough ?
i have a 1 and a half year old male neuter cat and a new 2 month old spay female kitten .
the first night i bring she home i do the sniff under the door thing and leave it at that .
the next day i let she out of the bedroom so they could check each other out , and the kitten hiss twice within the first 20 minute of meet each other and now she no longer hiss and they have be play ( chase each other up and down the hall , roll around on the ground and paw at each other ) .
only once it look like my male cat be bite at she neck and then she stomach and she be meow fairly loud and hiss once then he back off and now they be fine .
be they roughhouse play ?
or be they actually fight ?
he have be " bite " at she neck and stomach previously while they play without she meow or anything so i be wonder if he go a little to far that one time .
any answer help !!!!!!
you do not leave the new kitten in the room long enough .
you need to do that for a least a week , or else this type of territorial fighting will happen .
give the new kitten she own small territory will help she to feel safe and will give she a place to go to when scared .
right now , you male be fight off a intruder , and he feel that all of the house be he .
put she back in the room , and keep the door closed for a week .
then let she out for ten minute .
make it fifteen the next day , then twenty , and so on .
she will start to calm down and feel safe - you can bet she do not now .
she know she be invade someone else 's territory , but can not help it , and have no where to go .
she will be able to sleep without be afraid .
as well , you male will be able to see that he territory be not threaten .
when the door open , he will get that the one room be hers , and he will be ok with that .
the territory thing will be solve .
you male be hurt she to put she in she place - bite she scruff be dominance and bite the belly be a move cat use when hunt - to pull the gut out of they prey .
this be not good .
give they time to set up they territory , and once you bring the new kitten out , pay a lot of attention to the male .
you have bring someone else into he territory , and he need to be remind that you still love he , and support he claim to he space .
that will help to reassure he , and he will be less aggressive with she .
when they play fight , they do not hiss .
if they hiss , they be not play .
if they bite , and one cry , you must separate they , and you must keep a eye on they .
hissing be ok , unless they start to fight .
if that happen , separate they , and give they time apart .
put the girl in she territory will make she feel less afraid , and she will relax .
good luck !
a hiss be basically a " get the f*ck away " sound .
it mean they have go too far .
when they start bleed that mean they be really fight .
I have two cat , and at first they hiss at each other because cat be very territorial , but now they do fight and play .
the difference be when the cat hiss , that mean they be annoyed and they want the other cat to go away .
that mean they be fight .
when they be just jump at each other and they tail be wag that mean that they be play .
I can see how you get confused though . :)
what be the goal for North Vietnam in the Tet offensive ?
when Johnson deploy troops in 1964 he be advise by the military it would take a half - million troops about ten year to pacify South Vietnam .
he refuse to believe they and order the military to win the war within two to three year ( before the next election in 1968 ) .
he do not give they the number of troops they request .
this leave Westmoreland with few option , so he adapt a search and destroy strategy instead of a clear and defend strategy which be , in the long run , the preferred method of pacify a insurgency .
thing be , it work .
the ARVN be not have a big problem with the local VC ( the guerilla movement ) , they be be challenge by the main force VC ( which be light infantry ) and the North Vietnamese Army ( NVA ) .
when the Americans sweep in with they search and destroy operation the Communists quickly lean they could not stand up to the US firepower , and these regular troops be force to flee the country and take sanctuary across the border in Laos and Cambodia .
all those sunny report about the progress in Vietnam be correct , the Communists be be defeat .
however , Johnson would not let the military cross the border and clean out the Communist basis .
he be warn that they be build up a huge army and would eventually launch a attack , but he ignore he military adviser .
the Communists agree .
they could not defeat the Americans .
however , what they hope to do during the Tet Offensive be to sneak past the Americans and attack the ARVN in the urban area where they be deploy do successful clear and defend operation .
the Communists think they could defeat the ARVN , cause the fall of the south vietnamese government , and the people would than rally to the communist cause and leave the Americans strand in a sea of angry peasant .
that be the plan .
what happen ?
the Americans detect the attempt to infiltrate the urban area and be already redeploy troops from the rural area .
the ARVN rush back from holiday leave and counterattack .
within 24 hour every Communist assault have be defeat except in the ancient capital of Hue .
the government do not fall .
and the south vietnamese people ?
when give the ultimate choice , they rally .
to the south vietnamese government ..
Tet be a huge military and political disaster for the Communists .
they be chase back into Laos and Cambodia with the ARVN in hot pursuit .
the people reject they attempt to topple the government , and for all intent and purpose the US military ( and the ARVN ) hand Johnson the victory he have order they to achieve within the time - frame he order it .
all he have to do for a complete victory be allow the military to go into Laos and Cambodia and finish off the shattered Communist force .
but Johnson be so obtuse he do not understand he have a victory when it be hand to he on a silver platter .
instead he pull the military off , stop the bombing of North Vietnam , withdraw from the presidential race , and spend the rest of he term in office try to surrender to North Vietnam .
they screw up by not accept he surrender when he offer it .
the american people be not have any of it , and elect Richard Nixon to fix the mess LBJ have make ( not to surrender like the antiwar movement be demand ) .
in the end Nixon keep he promise for " . peace with honor .. "
but that be another question .
to emancipate the south , but it be a serious failure .
to make the war unpalatable to the american public .
in that , they pretty much succeed .
before Tet , the war be unpopular but tolerable to the majority of Americans in that the loss of american life be see as the cost of subdue the VC and NVA .
Tet make it clear that the war be a long way from be over if the Americans think they could preserve the South and that the North be perfectly willing to suffer great loss to continue they fight .
there be a very good book on the subject that be write by General Vo Nguyen Giap .
try google to find the title if you would like to read it .
bearded dragon question ... ?
I just buy a baby one yesterday .
I have a basking spot lamp that say it be a double reflector that focus 35 % more light / heat and provide beneficial uva ray important to the psycholical well - being of he .
my question be do that mean it give he not only the heat , but the " sun ray " he need ?
I also be wonder how long should this light be on .
the lady at pet smart say 4 hour , but on place on the net it say 10 to 12 hour .
he be get used to he new home , but have not eatin yet .
I have bearded dragon juvenile food and freeze - dry cricket .
any advice would be greatly appreciate .
thank you for you time .
uvb on the other hand can only be reproduce by a fluorescent source .
uvb will always be a separate bulb from the heat lamp , unless you use a mvb ( mercury vapor bulb ) which be the only reptile use bulb that will emit both uvb and heat from one bulb .
I highly recommend that you do not use coiled / compact uvb bulb as they be know to cause severe eye damage and / or blindness in reptile not to mention they have trouble maintain uvb output over time .
the long tube uvb bulb be best , like Zoomed 's Repsitun model : http://lllreptile.com/store/catalog/reptile-supplies/uvb-fluorescent-lights-mercury-vapor-bulbs/-/zoo-med-24-repti-sun-100-fluorescent-bulb/ remember to replace uvb bulb accord to the manufacturer 's recommendation after which time the bulb will no longer produce uvb even if visible light still be .
so , to answer you question , no , if you just have a bulb that say it produce UVA then you do not have " the sun 's ray " that you beard need .
you need to also provide a source of UVB lighting .
the person at Petsmart be very wrong ; in fact it be always a good idea to second guess what most pet store employee tell you ; they do not have the best track record regard give reliable pet care info .
UVB and bask temp ( should be about 110 F for a baby , 95 F for a adult ) should be available for 10 - 12 hour a day .
freeze dry food be not a good staple food source ; you need to offer live feeder insect .
bearded dragon be sight hunter , they need to see the food move to trigger a feed response , especially when they be baby .
Live food be also higher in nutritional value than freeze dried .
cricket , silk worm , phoenix worm , and various feeder roach , like red - lobster , turkistan , and dubia , be good example of staple insect to offer you beard .
Wax worm and meal worm should only be offer as treat item , for variety 's sake .
I would highly recommend that you read through some reliable beard guide to make sure you have everything set up correctly :
either way you also need to keep a eye on the temperature if you be use a dry fish tank as UV light in my experience up the temperature significantly and without proper ventilation it can become a oven .
that lady at PetSmart be a disgrace to the rest of we PetSmart associate ... sheesh .
yes , it give he the " sun ray " necessary , that be what UVA be .
and it should be on 10 - 12 hour , just like the sun would be up for 10 - 12 hour in he natural environment .
as for the heat , just be sure to use a thermometer .
I tell all my customer they can try it , but do not count on it .
also try green leafy veggy , like kale and spinach .
best of luck !
be a finch or a parakeet better ?
I be make a christmas list for my parent and i be go to ask for a bird and these be the affordable one that i like , and i be wonder : which would not bite alot , and which be more fun to have as pet and I need to know which would be quietest i honestly do not care but my family do !
please help I !
hi there ,
please choose the parakeet ...
here be my reason .....
I do the same thing that you do for christmas .
I end up get a pair of zebra finch for christmas .
at first it be all cool and all .
they be chirp and do they every day business .
they be quite messy and you can not hold or pet they .
I have try to tame they and they just would not get tame .
they do not want to be hold or touch .
I want a bird that I can hold and do trick .
I still have they and they be do well .
a couple of month after I get parakeet / budgie .
they be adorable they have beautiful color and personality .
I love they .
first of all they be very tame .
I tame they in 4 day .
they can do trick and they be not messy .
the whole family love they .
my parent even play with they .
they be a big part of we family .
I hope this help you with you decision .
they be both about the same noise level .
when choose a parakeet look for a young one .
look for a lot of stripe in they head that start from the beak and go back to the back of the bird .
the stripe be like hair the less stipe the older .
( think of a bald man lol ) look for clean feather .
if you want a boy the cere ( the nostril piece above the beak ) must be blue .
the girl have either pink or brown .
I would recommend that you get two parakeet .
but get either one male and one female , or two male .
do not get two female .
they sometimes do not get along ( you know how some girl be lol hahahaahh but for real though , two girl tend to fight a lot .
I have one yellow girl and a green and yellow boy .
they be the best !
if you choose to get a parakeet this be a trick that I use to tame they .
however if you plan on get one , then get more than one at the same time they need company .
my mom tell I how to tame they and I be very happy with the result .
it take I 4 day to get the new one to be able to step on and eat out of my hand .
these be the step I use .
honestly they have work for I twice with my parakeet .
hopefully they will work for you .
1 ) when you get the bird , place he or she or they in the cage .
leave they in there with food and water and such for about 2 hour .
2 ) then place you hand in the cage .
I take the cage and place it next to the couch .
then I sit on the couch , place one hand in the cage , hold a millet spray .
( this way the will associate you hand with food , and bird love food lol ) then I turn on the tv and watch .
this way they will see that you hand be good and it be not go to grab they or hurt they .
do this for about one hour .
( you can take break if you have to ) and repeat the step after about 2 hour .
3 ) after about day 2 , they will start to eat the millet spray from you hand .
( do not take away the food dish from the bird , they will associate you as the person who take away they food ) ....
then take you finger and place it under they belly , in front of they feet and say up .
push you finger to they foot gently and say up .
( the first couple of time they will fly all over the cage but as long as you do not jump back or screem they will get used to you ) they will have no choice but to go on you finger .
when they see that you be not harm they , the will go up on you finger when you say up .
4 ) if they be not go up by now you just get to keep try and keep try .
do not hit , yell , or harm they .
you have patience .
do not give up !
after a couple of week mines know when I say shoulder it mean to go on my sholder , when I say up it mean to jump up on my finger , when I say up and out it mean up on my finger and out of the cage .
and when I say go home it mean to go in the cage .
good luck !
they work for I and I hope they work for you !
they be awesome !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
and that be my reason why you should choose a parakeet over a finch .
a parakeet be friendlier
they be normally quiet and it be easy to take care of they .
they be also friendly .
I have a parakeet name Cookie . :p
when be the best time to travel to Ireland ?
my sister and I would like to go to Ireland .
I graduate in the spring , and so we would like to go between then and winter .
we do not want too many tourist , and since we will both be out of school we can go anytime between the middle of June to early November .
can anyone give I a idea of when the best time for we to go to Ireland would be ?
people do not go to Ireland on holiday for the weather , it be unpredictable .
one thing you can be sure of about irish weather be how little you can be sure of .
it may be shirtsleeve and sunglass in February , but winter woolly in March and even during the summer .
County Kerry be the worst affect .
the southeast be the driest , enjoy a more continental climate .
the irish weather work on the ' four season in a day ' principle , which basically mean that you can not predict a thing when it come to the behaviour of the sky .
some basic assumption , however , can be make .
it be also peak tourist season , which mean there be far more people just about everywhere but the most remote corner of the island , and price be at they highest .
not surprisingly , most of the yearly festival occur during these time so as to take advantage of the crowd and the more favourable weather .
spring ( February to April ) and Autumn ( August to October ) make good alternative , although the country 's ever - grow popularity as a tourist destination can often blur the line between mid - and high - season tourism .
still , you have a better chance of some peace and quiet , and the weather can be surprisingly better in April and September than in mid-July - again , it be all part of the uncertainty principle .
Spring festivity include the ever - popular St Patrick 's Festival .
although temperature do not often venture below freezing , winter ( December to February ) can be brutal , for huge part of the country - the west and northwest in particular .
crowd be at they thinnest , but many of the country 's tourist attraction and service close down in October and do not reopen until Easter , which paradoxically leave visitor with a more convincing taste of how Ireland be experience by most of the irish : it be cold , grey and dark by 5 pm , but there be always a pub to escape into when the rain start sheet down .
as that famous Scotsman Billy Connolly say " there be no such thing as bad weather just the wrong clothes "
afraid I can not be more helpful , it be really a case of pot luck , although as the weather be so changeable often a cold wet morning will turn into a lovely warm sunny afternoon and evening or visa versa .
if you mean the Republic of Ireland ( Dublin ) then anytime .
the summer there be much more mild than most of the US ( be you come from the US ? ) .
they season be the same as all the country in the northern hemisphere but I would suggest fall .
it do get pretty cold in Ireland so go before winter be you best bet .
September for example .
rent a car and spend a couple day outside of Dublin see the countryside and you will have the trip of a lifetime .
you could stay in a city & get a bus tour to say the Cliffs of Moher or Dingle peninsula but you will be with all the other tourist .
by definition most tourist will go to the best place so you might have to put up with a few tourist along the way .
we use we bbq on precisely 4 occasion .
Autumn be from mid August onwards as far as the weather go if not officially accord to the calender .
the day start to shorten & it get even wetter , windier & colder .
we have frost in October so I would not advise visit late in the year to be honest , spring time be you best bet .
you do realise it be quite expensive to visit Ireland ?
you be go to need a few thousand dollar save up for flight , insurance , food , accommodation & spending money .
eat out in particular be quite expensive compare to America I believe .
golden wonder killifish breeding help ?
I have 4 golden wonder killifish .
1 of they be really colorful and be about 6 cm long .
2 of they be kinda whitish and be about 4 - 5 cm long .
the last one be colourful too but it be about 4 cm long .
I feed they flake , and live earthworm uncut everyday .
can you tell I the whole process of breed they and take care of the baby ?
thanks in advance .
if they be able to take earthworm uncut , that be really impressive !
I aspire to you feeding regime , flake early and something live later in the day .
worm ( and daphnia ) be also rich in lipid , substance important in form egg and grow young .
I think that you understand that you largest and smallest golden wonder be male .
if you would like more on sex out Aplocheilus lineatus take a look at the discussion in the first source below .
if you have plant in you tank .
you lineatus be already spawn .
if condition be favorable ( 78 - 82 f ) and the fish be obviously well feed as yours be , they will spawn .
( I have even have a pair of killy leave egg on a float thermometer !
if you wish to pick egg make a acrylic spawning mop .
check out the second source .
I prefer darker color because I can see they egg , more easily and the fish look better next to they .
use a well rinse medicine vial , a cork , new fishing bobber or even a piece of non-crumbly styrofoam to float they .
there be a couple way one could spawn lineatus - mop spawn & water incubate they for two week , pick egg from a mop & put they in a tray of treated , seasoned water or set up the parent in a plant tank & move they so the fry can hatch out there .
if you have the room to separate the male ( s ) & female ( s ) , & feed they well on live food , ( assume that you be do weekly 50 % water change ) when you put they together they will leave a lot more egg .
just make up example , but if a pair be constantly together , they may lay 10 - 15 egg a day .
with extra blackworm and maybe freeze ( defrost , rinse ) freeze food earlier in the day , they may leave 30 - 40 egg at a time .
separate and feed extremely nourishing stuff , they may produce more .
separate a pair some time before a show ( killy be usually show & judge & often sell as pair ) will encourage they to court and show they best color .
they also start the day with no nick or ding in they fin .
the water change help with that too .
you also may need to treat the incubation water .
the chlorine and ammonia ( choramine ) be not good for the egg .
ironically sometimes it be wise to leave the newly pick egg in fresh tap water with some chlorination to kill microscopic critter that ride in with the egg .
then put the egg in water treat a couple of day before with a water treatment and leave open to " breathe " .
leave a jar with a dozen black worm in it will sate the adult 's desire for snack and they be more likely to leave fry or egg alone .
if a pair be not leave egg ... check the follow :
1 . be a tank mate ( such as another female killie or a cory or large snail ) rate the egg ?
2 . have we keep up with partial water change ?
3 . be there too much mineral in the water ?
aplo. lineatus be wide - spread over southern India .
that indicate that they thrive in different water chemistry .
still if you can get you pet shop to do a hardness or tds ( total dissolve solid ) test , that may give you a hint .
wing it a little here , a hardness of 100 to nearly 200 ppm ( part per million ) or 5.8 to 10.6 dh should be fine for gardnerus .
tds meter ( the thrifty aquarist 's hardness meter can be use if one have see one of you municipal water department 's annual report .
they include a number of mineral there and you can figure out what percentage of that would be you hardness mineral ( calcium , magnesium and iron ) .
a number of mineral be not of much consequence .
however if there be a high level of sodium chloride ( common salt ) that can break down the chorion ( shell ) around the egg and allow critter to get in and eat the yoke and embryo . )
ironically sometimes it be wise to newly pick egg in fresh tap water with some chlorination to kill microscopic critter that ride in with the egg .
then put the egg in water treat a couple of day before with a water treatment and leave open to " breathe " .
if you get egg in the mail in a medicine vial , that be fine .
but get the egg out , maybe rinse in fresh tap water and then into the incubation water .
in time the egg can suffocate in the shipping container .
after a number of people begin complain about " mystery death " among incubate egg , some of the more advanced killie people begin suggest that after 7 - 8 day of incubation , one should do a 100 % water change - as the egg develop , they do release waste material .
another problem be that sometimes bad egg will fungus and the fungus will spread out and kill all the egg .
some people put in a very dilute Acriflaven solution to slow down the fungus , so one can take white egg out with a pipette or eyedropper .
other will add a drop of Methylene blue .
if a egg turn blue , it have die and then become dyed as the outer membrane break down .
get those out asap too .
hope there be useful grist for the mill here .
Disney cruise line with young one ?
I will be take my 3 and 4 yr old .
what be the best time of year ?
should I get a balcony ?
any tip or advice to make this a great experience ??
it be vacation time .
many family be set to plan a best holidaying .
they look for fun fill , rejuvenating and memorable vacation .
there can be many idea ; one can see numerous option pass through they mind .
what be the best option ?
especially if you be plan to spend couple day with family and kid , which best suit you can select ?
Disney cruise , be a simple answer to this .
there be many reason to say Disney cruise be the best bet for you to have a enjoyable holiday tour .
from 1998 onwards , from its inception Disney cruise have attract many and continue to attract more and more .
this be a spectacular ship , a very popular choice of family to spend they leisure time .
the ship be design thematically , with imposing animated cartoon character .
do you feel that the holidaying with the animated cartoon will impress only young one ?
no , the luxurious facility and fun fill activity in the Disney cruise be very attractive to people of all age .
whatever be the age , you will have the choice of variety of activity to forget about you hectic day - to - day activity .
kid fun game and video show be add to the other facility .
there be two ship , Disney magic and Disney wonder .
both be make keep in mind the comfort of the traveler .
Disney cruise offer 24 - hour room service , and the crew be ready to serve you the way you like .
it have get very spacious room , furnish completely and neatly .
these be decorate uniquely and marvelously .
the ship offer variety of eatables , deliciously make .
sea fish , prawn and many nice option be there in different restaurant aboard .
there be many good option of delicious food on the shore as well .
there be special region uniquely and imposingly design for the child .
they can spend many hour enjoy the Disney world magic .
these theme park have all type of facility .
video show , cartoon story , wonderful game and many such facility .
it be really a entertainment for the kid .
the amusing world of cartoon and story will be a memorable experience for the child .
there be other amnesty also .
these include space for dance and music , bar facility , gambling facility for the elder , spaciously make open area aboard and many such nice facility .
also one can keep they privacy in the cabin and make the time in seclusion .
to relax and to rejuvenate Disney cruise be the best option .
there be many online site offer the booking facility with affordable rate .
you can select the proper route and travel plan by consult the agent prior to the booking ........
off season be good , however , the Disney cruise be almost always completely book .
I would suggest a warmer season , but not spring break or early summer .
you may also want to avoid Thanksgiving week and the Christmas holiday .
with young one , I would definitely get a window or view room so they can see outside .
do not feel guilty about take they there .
we like get the late dinner seating , so you have more time to see movie and stuff but if you kid be ' early to bed ' you may want the earlier seating for dinner .
bring some sort of magnet or small magnetic whiteboard for you door .
all of the door tend to look alike and have ' something ' on you door help you and you kid find you room easier .
you can also leave note for the rest of you family ( husband ) about where you be at any give point .
cell phone do not work on board but they give you a ' walkie - talkie ' kind of phone in you room that will work onboard .
each evening you will get a ' magazine ' call the Navigator which list all of the activity for the next day .
any time would be great .
off season cruise might actually be better with preschooler as price might be lower in the off season .
my wife and I , in we 60' at the time , originally plan a 3 generation trip but some family emergency cause everyone else to cancel .
we have a ball .
we have a inside cabin and it be what I would recommend .
the child can be check in and check out in a safe way at many activity so you can have a bit of free time without the little one .
the range of activity can be illustrate by describe the water activity .
you will never be so spoiled in you life as you be on a Disney cruise .
if you stay with you dining schedule , every night be dinner and a show .
the real payoff be that you will have the same waiter for the entire cruise .
we waiter quickly grasp the fact that I like ginger ale and rather spicy food while my wife 's taste run to lemonade and less spicy fare .
since they know we preference , we almost always go along with they menu suggestion and be never sorry we do .
obviously they have a full beverage list include alcohol for adult who want it .
if you should miss a meal , you also miss a great show .
I think I gain three pound in my week long cruise .
this be about my farrier , girl .
that be why I be post here !
I post this in singles and dating too , so I have just copy and paste .
well , I will try to make this short .
I have know this guy for a long time , but we have never be good friend or anything .
he be my farrier ( shoe my horse 's foot ) so I be technically a client if you want to view it that way .
well , almost two week ago he come out and do my horse 's foot and be so flirty .
he always hug I when he come , but he give I at least 5 tight , long , back rub hug while he be there .
we be also just talk about my horse 's crappy foot and he mention .
" well , if you ever just want to see I I will come out and look he over and then we can grab a coffee after . "
that have never happen before so I be kinda realize at that point that he be a little interested .
anyway , so he end up leave one nail out of my horse 's foot ( I have never hear of a farrier do this ) and tell I to call he in a few day ( first it be a week , then it be a few day lol ) and he would come back out and put it in .
he tell I to remember to call like 3 time before he leave .
so , I wait a week to call because I be busy and I want to have he come out on a day when I be more available in case we be to hang out after ;)
anyway , so that be 2 day ago that I call and leave a message , but he still have not call back yet .
I do not know if I should call he again tomorrow or not ?
I know a lot of people say to wait until he call you , but it be different because I be a client and technically that be all I be at this point .
on the other hand though , if I be a client he should really have call back by now because you do not leave a customer hang .
he do not have my number either because this be the first time I have call he instead of he dad .
it be a father and son business .
anyway , I would appreciate any insight on this at all .
thank you for reading if you do ! :)
ok , well as far as he be a bad farrier for leave a nail out - that be not the case , they be extremely well know farrier in the area .
I would be a lot more concerned if the shoe fall off because it be miss one lousy nail .
the reason he say he do not put that nail in be because he " do not want to risk it " with my horse 's horrible foot .
this be about the fourth time they have do my horse 's foot because I just switch back to they .
the only reason I switch away from they in the first place be because my good friend who apprentice with they be start out on he own .
however , he leave my horse without a shoe for two week ( now that be what I call a crap farrier ) .
which , I might add be the same foot that keep crumble with the nail .
so , obviously I switch back to these guy .
ok , calm down , it be not like he be some stranger that come up and grope I lol .
I have know the guy for about 10 year .
I be 21 , so yeah we be both kid when we know each other !
he be a few year older than I .
and yes , I do like he .
to answer Barry White , yes that do occur to I :) I hope that be all he be wait for .
on the other hand , he could very easily just call I and say hey I be busy right now , I will call you when I can come out .
I have never do that before though either .
and they usually come out within a few day .
he will call you back I be sure !
sound like he really like you ..
but you need to ask yourself do you feel the same way ?
would you like go for * coffee * with he ?
or be he not you type ?
or be you undecided ?
if i be you I would go ...
I would say if he do not call you back by friday call he again he could be play hard to get ?
I think he leave the nail out of the shoe as a excuse to come back and see you hey he may be you Prince charming ..
edit ... I really do not think you horse be in danger of be hurt with one nail miss ..
I have see horse loose nail on there own and do just fine with one nail go now if he have leave out 2 or 3 I would be wonder to ...
I really do belive he leave the nail out because of the horse 's hoof condition and it be a add bonus he would get to see she again
when I be younger in my early 20 my farrier be a hottie name Joby .. ( for those who do not know I be a girl read my bio on my page ) dumb as a post about everything but horse ..
he be in he 30 divorced and have 2 kid .. but we both flirt horribly with each other .. but neither one of we take the chance and ask to other on a date . :(
sort a wonder what it would have be like ?
but that be year ago .
he have this habit of tell you everything ..
well one day he say to I you know i do not wear underwear as he be bend over work on my mare 's right front hoof .. and I be like ummmm okay ???
I be glad he butt be face I so he could not see my red face I think my mare be even laugh ..
well 6 week later when he come back out he be again work on my mare 's front Foot and I look down and yeah he have whole in he pants in the wrong place I bust out laugh and he be like what ???
I be like ummmm i can see you ass cheek ... he be like oops do i forget my underwear ???
that be a strange way to flirt .. but i guss it be he way ...
I be heartbroken .. but then realize he be not the guy for I ..
wow he do sound interested in you , my farrier never give I hug like that ( probably a good thing as he have a wife and 2 kid ) anyway , I find that they can be very busy so I would wait a week lo9nger and if still no reply give he a call but do not leave a message so you do not have to necessarily wait for he to call .
from the point of view of a business , and client / operator relationship , he be do a really shitty job .
leave nail out so you will call and have he come back out later ?
cute or not , I would call a different bloke because he be do a sub-par job at something he need to be do he best at , whether he be flirt or try to ask you out or not , he ought to put quality first .
this be , after all , he business , and if he want you to remain a customer why on earth be he do shoddy work ?
might be something different ?
I have the opportunity to pick up a super nice 6 year old for free .
he be not lame , but he be be have issue .
here be what the owner have say :
I have a 5 year old that lose all of he cheek muscle on the right side about 3 - 4 month ago .
I chalk it up to possible nerve damage , because this be what the vet think and the other cheek muscle be fine and he have no theeth problem .
so I send he to the trainer the first of September to be start on the barrel .
I get he back the first of the month and he have lose some weight but attribute that to be work everyday ( I expect he to drop some ) .
he be now lose the cheek muscle on the left side of he face and seem to be drop weight by the day .
have he to a dentist yesterday and there be no tooth problem .
he can eat all he feed and do not drop any , but can not eat hay from lack of muscle to chew it .
he be gant look in he flank area and be lose topline muscle .
the only neurological sign that he show be that he barely drag he toe and sometimes have trouble with he right lead .
the horse I have post about a couple week ago with the atrophy cheek muscle be down to he last resort for life .
I can not afford to treat whatever be wrong with he .
no , I have not do a epm test but have do a extensive blood panel and my vet do a neurological physical exam .
we elect to not do the epm test because there be no neurological sign .
he be still show no sign other than the weight loss , and some muscle atrophy .
he eat all of he grain but it just take he a while to get it chew because of the lack of muscle in he jaw .
so I might get the horse and see what I can do .
will be get a copy of the blood result the owner have already run as well .
my other theory would be wobbler .
I will be have my equine chiro / acupuncturist out to do some work as well if I do get he ....
so any idea ?
think I should do it ?
horse be out of state and not local .
owner be willing to meet I half way with he .
I will be call my vet and chiro about he .
worse come to worse , I be out of the $ $ and have to put he down anyway or have a pretty pasture ornament .
he be still rideable currently and not have many issue under saddle .
this be a horse that I otherwise would not be able to afford and even if I spend 2 k on treatment I come out ahead of he purchase price .
I post what the owner have say in paragraph 2 & 3 , that be not I to clarify .
she be the one that can not afford to do anything else for he in case he do not recover fully .
he can eat grain and I already have a feed regimen in my head for the guy since he can not eat regular hay .
I do not think it will be hard to keep he weight up so long as he can eat the grain .
I be not go to go pick up a horse I can not afford .
I be willing to pull the epm test and treat .
the owner be the one who be unable .
July be when he start to exhibit slight symptom and the owner and vet originally think it be just some nerve damage from something in the pasture with no visible injury .
he be only exhibit weight loss and some muscle atrophy , with the slight toe drag and a bit of trouble with the right lead ( which could or could not be relate ) .
the horse be not in pain .
he be not starve .
he be drop we
the horse be not in pain .
he be not starve .
he be drop weight , but most of that come from be at the trainer 's and be ride hard for 60 day .
he be not put it back on .
I know that I have the possibility of treat he and still have to put he down .
at the same time I do know people who have have horse come back successfully after epm .
I know this be go to be expensive .
I be willing to give it a shot .
Gallop , I have already read that whole site and be read through research article from the research college as well .
look at study , treatment option and such .
I will have the epm test do before treat .
the chiro / acupuncturist will be there to evaluate the horse for wobbler which be often cause by spinal compression and can be confuse with epm .
if that be the case then acupuncture be not go to hurt he .
it be actually one of the alternative therapy for epm
I think it be wonderfully responsible that you be go into this rescue eye open and be get the opinion of qualified professional ( and a bunch of yahoo ) before you decide to take this horse on .
I do think some Y!A user need to work on they reading comprehension as I can not comprehend how take a horse in as a rescue and get it qualified medical treatment be abuse .
worst case scenario you fall in love and after spend thousand of dollar you have to put the horse down .
be that something you be up for ?
if so go for it and I will give you all the moral support I can as you figure out what be up .
it be heartbreaking to try to bring a horse back and then have to put it down , but some horse be worth the risk .
if you feel this guy be worth it then I hope you vet can figure thing out .
as to epm like Shee say be in MI we have have to deal with it .
pretty much every large stable have here .
we first diagnose epm horse be back when there be no treatment in the US and only a experimental chicken feed additive in Canada .
we haul the horse to Windsor and get he treat there .
that horse return to racing and we do not notice much difference .
I have no idea if that be related or farmer be do a better job of clear out opossum now because they know opossum be carrier , but we have not have a epm horse in at least 10 year .
I can say all of we epm horse be treat early when they be show mild sign like Shee give and all return to racing .
one horse even get he lifetime mark after be treat for epm .
the only difference we notice be that the epm horse seem to do worse on the smaller track after .
it might just be coincidence or the fact those great big trotter with those extremely long back lose a bit of fine coordination to get those gangly body around those tighter turn .
I do not know .
MSU do a lot of epm study because of how common it be here .
you may want to see if you can get in touch with they epm group and get this guy in a study .
I know they do lab work show that Strongid C use daily could help prevent epm .
I believe they have a real study test the lab work in real world situation now , but it may be some time before those result be release .
another thought with this be a mosquito season from hell could it be West Nile ?
West Nile can cause epm like symptom and do not always include a fever .
let we know what you decide to do .
you hate to see talent get waste , but honestly I do not think I could take in a horse right now these issue .
personally I think you should just keep on walk by .
you should have you chiro out before you decide if you want this horse or not .
even if you can figure out what be wrong with this poor poneh , there be always the chance for remission and then relapse so you may have to do deal with again in the future .
so all in all , put the money up front before take on this horse .
a few hundr out of pocket now will possibly save you thousand once the horse be in you name .
could he have have a blow to the head cause this atrophy ?
or a difficult birth ?
be it always like this ?
or have it occur since birth .
I also wonder if he might have have a slight stroke ?
I think if you can not afford to get he treat that you should not consider he as a prospect .
who know what the future might hold , and it might be expensive ?
extremely bad customer service
do not go to this salon , especially if you have to get you hair straighten .
they do a very bad job with my hair and be extremely rude when I go back to ask they why it do not work for my hair .
rude , insensitive , discourteous people !!!!!
he do not prescribe pain med or other drug , he use he bodytalk method which be unusual but the result be undeniable .
my neck be fixed !.
he know what he be do .

but furniture like this will truly be around forever .
the internet here be terrible .
like the previous poster say , the com line be split between the entire building .
that be 3 x worse than Qwest DSL 's lowest speed offering !
the outward appearance make you think this place be nice , but everything inside be cheap cheap cheap .

before you buy anything in NY , make sure you stop by Jack 's first .

for a hotel like this you would expect some form of free internet .
what you get be a $ 13 / day charge to access the internet through a slow 512 / 512 kb / s that you can only use to check email etc ( read : no downloading ) .
other than that the hotel be in a good location and the breakfast be great

claim he be too busy for two test drive .
we be the only customer there !
do not waste time , just drive 10 minute more down to Stevens Creek , they actually do try to help they customer there !
eat here a couple time .
it be not a high end steak house , more of the cuisine BRETT enjoy in MISSISSIPPI .
so , if you want a burger and fries , well , it be ok .
if you want a little cajunish food - it be good .
if you want a steak , well , this be not the best in GREEN BAY .
overall decent but if you be expect a RUTH CHRIS type steak , this be not it .
good place to be on a Sunday night .
the beer be good , nice choice of beer as well , and as usual the mussel be great , the place upstairs be a nice addition to the bar downstairs .
fill up on too much beer and hence can not comment on the food .
but the menu have standard stuff that one would get at a belgian tavern .
if you be a handcraft beer person , this be a fantastic place to be .
perfect location plus
I move into the Tanglewood Apartments in late 2008 and it be be a refresh change .
I use to live at Meadowrun and that be a nightmare .
the manager - Tiffany - be actually very nice so I be a bit surprised by other comment .
she be very reachable and she have always respond quickly to any question or request .
plus she plan a monthly breakfast and other event at the clubhouse which be a nice add benefit .
great service / deal - support this local business
I have use these guy for new snow , fix lot of flat , use replacement tire , and oil change .
they have the best price locally and good customer service .
overall - good stuff .
another great business bite the dust !
the best cake ever !
a bit pricey , so I do not go very often , but it be always a treat when I do .
the price be worth what I get .
I be assume they be completely out of business since I can not find any contact information .
I be hope the baker continue to do they baking out of another place , because it would be a shame not to have these cake any longer .
super nice people , really good food
what I love most about this place , other than the food , be that eat here make you feel like you be in a small town rather than Baltimore .
the owner be really nice , they serve good food at a good price , and the option to eat outside on the deck ( esp on the weekend whether there be hardly any traffic ) be great .
one of my top 5 place to eat in Baltimore .
this place be identical to the Youngstown Sports Grille , so I imagine they be own / operate by the same people .
the food be mediocre at best , and largely overpriced give the portion size and quality .
do not even get I start on how expensive it be to drink there .
I have eat here 3 time since they first open , and the service have be poor each time , the staff always come across as somewhat rude and slow .
app 4 salad 3 entree 3.5 wine 5 ( NOV 07 )
enjoy this cozy little spot with a group of 8 folk .
service be excellent .
food be excellent .
wine be excellent .
I be feel the need for some fish so I have the salmon which be very good but the steak look amazing and if I be in town again , I will definitely order a steak .
a perfect place for a romantic dinner .
lot of " pretty people " dine inside .
great staff .
very helpful !!!!
they interview I , give I test in the software I include on my resume , and place I in a position that I keep for several year .
re-interview and be go on interview for a new job .
I be really thankful for the folk at HR Office .
they be dependable , have great connection in the community , and be a great resource for find a job .
I highly recommend they to all of my friend !!!! !
great experience - consider check out they puppy before buy from a breeder !
I adopt a 3.5 month old yellow lab last winter from the Dumb Friends League .
the staff be very helpful in find the right dog for I and the care my pup receive be outstanding .
if you be on the lookout for a pure breed pup do not forget to check out the shelter !
my pup have a wonderful temperment and have be a wonderful addition to my family !
food good , service poor
no silverware , ask for a spoon for my son 's mac and cheese end up have to use my tea spoon .
ask for bar - b - que sauce never get it .
never check back with we once we get we food .
have to go the the bus boy 's station ourselves to get napkin .
only one server , too buys talk with other I guess .
food be good , but service mean a lot to I .
Dr. Chao you be the best dentist I have ever have .
you be knowledgeable , professional , gentel and kind .
I wish I have you as my dentist early on in my life - maybe my tooth would have be a lot better than they be now , however I be glad you be my dentist now .
even though you be expensive .
thank you for help to preserve my teeth .
you be meticulous in you work and it show in my smile .
I bring my car in for a simple emission test .
I guess they figure I for a easy mark , and try to explain that my car would not pass unless I replace a hose .
ten minute later , I take my car down the street and it pass the emission test with fly color .
if you be a fan of herpes , be rip off , and child molester , this be the garage for you .
if not , go somewhere else .
even though I have never try hoa salon but I agree with other reviewer that they be rude .
I call and ask about the price for hair updo and the receptionist or owner who aswer the phone refuse to tell I , or even just give I a approximate price range .
he tell we to stop by the salon and then he will tell we the price .
what kind of rude service be that ?
I do not want to waste my time with they .
top notch eat !
so here we be in Manson .
yes , Manson .
right near Chelan .
aka Nowheresville .
and this litttle gem of a 7 - table restaurant be a complete and utterly wonderful surprise .
a short but wide - range menu execute with innovative perfection in a cozy hole in the wall just off the main street .
fantastic food serve without pretense , very reasonably price wine selection .
a great place to go for dinner after a day of wine tasting .
excellent service and reasonable price
boutique store deal in child 's clothing / gift be often outrageously price ( who want to pay 40 dollar for a newborn onesie ? )
but I be pleasantly surprised to find that the Purple Goose 's price be reasonable ( for the same product find at other area boutique , the price be 20 - 25 % cheaper ) .
the service be also excellent - friendly , helpful and informative without be overbearing .
will definitely return .
a lack of organisation , couple with the distain for its customer , make this the worst rental agency I have use .
chase they on issue from the day I move in ( many of they still unresolved as I leave ) to all sort of farcical issue with fund , after I leave . . . . as soon as I could .
if you must use they , be vigilant and be ready to push , if you can go elsewhere then I would .
amazing night - great party spot !!
go to the Willow Lounge this past weekend for dinner and drink ... place be awesome .
have to keep in mind that the a / c break , I feel bad it be they opening !
anyway , once that be fix , this place will be amazing .
drink be awesome , price reasonable , and staff friendly .
this be a awesome date spot that the area seriously need .
check out the Willow Lounge , you will be happy !
it be be a few year since I have be to Ipanema .
and , I can say , this be one of my favorite place to eat in all of Richmond .
do not let the nondescript building entrance fool you , these be some creative and talented chef ... two thumb way , way up !
excellent food , fantastic wait staff
I recently throw a surprise birthday party for my wife at Fraiser 's .
the management be easy to deal with during the planning stage , and the execution by the kitchen and wait staff be flawless .
I highly recommend Fraiser 's for anyone plan a special event for friend , family or business .
fantastic store !!!
I come upon this store as the building catch my eye .
it be locate in the huge HONKA Log Homes building , by Walmart off of Evergreen Parkway .
the store be decorate with furnishings & accessory .
the friendly crew work be great & very helpful .
this store be what Colorado be all about .
also , I purchase some furniture last year and all have be great !
it's durability & look be perfect and I will definitely be add to my collection soon !
lovely people , great hat
I be sadden to see the review that claim World Hats Mart have poor service .
it lead I to believe that the reviewer simply have difficulty tolerate people with strongly - accented English .
the husband and wife who run this spot be lovely people .
we have have many conversation with they and they have always be extremely patient with I as I try on multiple hat in search of the right costume for my magic act .
I recommend they highly !
do not ever go there , not even if you car flip .
they service suck to start off with , people be cruel and ignorant .
I be compeltly dissatisfied with they service and they product .
they do not have a return policy and even if they product suck , they will not take it back !
do not ever go here .
I prefer Advanced auto parts over this crappy place with the meanest people .
and they thrive to get a customer .
do not go here .. thank you
I have be grow my hair out for 1 year plus and go in to get 1 inch take off .
I walk out with 5 inch long hair on the top , 2 inch long hair on the side , and 1.5 in the back .
my hair be uneven and it look rediculous .
this woman should be work in supercuts ... if that .
this be a terrible experience and I hope that no one else go through that .
do your self a favor and do not go to this establishment .
the worst Burger King restaurant !!!
I generally like the BK over the other fast serve restaurant ; however , I regrete to visit this restaurant at my town .
this be a shame of my adorable town , Branford .
I order a kid meal with a milk and find a bottle be half open already .
I ask they to change it but they rudely say that it be okay .
disgusting french fries be very best menu .
do not go , or you will learn how to waste you money .
the bad : I be at Napa recently and be unpleasantly surprised at poor waiter svce and subpar food .
we be a party of 4 and none of we be particularly pleased with we dish .
Napa be all about wine but give very short description of the wine on they list .
if you must go ask lot of question about you selection since you expectation may as high as mine be .
we walk in to pick we little man at 10 minute to closing and hear laughter from kid and the staff .
the facility be more than adequate and the staff be just phenomenal .
they sense of humour and calmness when deal with the little one amaze I every time I walk in .
we have since move slightly further away from the centre but it be worth the extra travel , as the care provide exceed we expectation ... especially after a few horrendous daycare experience elsewhere .
horrible !!!! !
this have to be some of the worst pizza I have ever have the misfortune of order .
the crust be lopsided , thicker on one side than the other .
it actually have a hole in one of the slice .
there be minimal cheese and sauce and it completely lack flavor .
I know New York pizza and this be not it !!
this be nothing like New York style pizza !!!.
I love pizza and this be a complete and utter disappointment !!
I would not suggest this pizza to anyone !!!
best quote ever my gate be stuck halfway open so I call A CLASS Garage Doors dr service .
they come to my house in no time and start work on the gate .
they be very friendly and be able to explain I exactly what be wrong with it .
once they fix it they answetr all of my question with no hesitation and then give I the best quote ever .
I know that if my garage door need to be repair , I will be call A CLASS Garage Doors
you will be happy at this store !
Allen Tire be recommend by friend after my have bad tire experience in Temecula .
the store manager , Jim Smith , make a excellent tire recommendation for my newly acquire Lexus .
tire be the right price and now the car feel like it be ride on rail around turn .
the store be clean , run very professionally and a pleasure to be in .
they know they job and you do not have to watch they to be sure everything be do right .
excellent service , not only do they get the exact car I want win in 48 hour but the sale man also take I out to lunch .
very kind and reliable .
I highly recommend this dealership if you would not like to hassle on price and receive friendly service .
I have since purchase two car from this dealership , the first one be from Phillip and the second be from Richard .
both be excellent sale man who put my need first .
this place have do a great job of take care of the usual maintenance on my hooptie .
I also never have to wait long for a yearly inspection sticker ... and never get the usual excuse other shop always give I ... " the inspection guy be not here today " .... for example .
today I go into Kwik Kar and there be two car in front of I for inspection ... but I be still out of there pretty quick ... barely have time to read a chapter in my book .
extremely helpful and professional
as first - time home buyer , my husband and I find Stephanie Fairchild at Prudential Steamboat Realty , extremely helpful .

Stephanie 's knowledge of the market and property in we price range , make we feel secure in we decision to buy when we do .
we would highly recommend Stephanie to anyone look for a home in the Yampa Valley .
we appreciate she patience , knowledge and kindness !
firstly , the other reviewer clearly have never be to Nick 's , or he would know that Nick only charge $ 13 for a haircut which be pretty much industry standard .
I have be go to Nick for 5 month now precisely because he do pay attention to detail .
I have terrible hair and he really take he time to make it look right .
some of the younger kid that work there be a bit sub par , but if you wait for Nick ... you will be good .
get some nice " freshly bake " fruit square , a personal favorite of mine .
take a bite , it taste odd .
flip the square over and see it riddled with green mold !!!!
I call the store and the clerk giggle , and agree that it be gross , but say it be not she problem .
she also refuse to get a manager .
I leave my number , or try to anyway .
same clerk have considerable difficulty take down a number .
I will never go back there again
for cheap chinese food , this be the place to go .
I use to eat at place like New China or Green Buffet in Troy , MO - nothing terrible but not that great .

thank you Roll UP Crepes !
this be one of the worst place I have stay , we cut our stay short and go to the Mulberry .
even though they still charge you the day you book but will not use , it be worth the get the hell out of this crap hole .
the whole experience show a hotel manage by what must be a 2 star hotel manager .
bad service start from the front desk .
the best person be the valet .
short of that , avoid this place , as a silver Marriott member , this be a disgrace .
best place in AMES
I live here for two year when the price be a little lower :) the place be very nice and clean , and in great condition !
I really enjoy the staff at Wessex , also the manager Sherri be always very nice and helpful .

[ no homo ] :d
friendly , fine food
the one - star review from 2005 be out of date .
there be a change of ownership a couple of year ago and service be both quick and extremely friendly .
the atmosphere may not be for everyone .
it be a bustling place where separate party be seat at the same table ( as in many european cafe ) , but if you be ok with that , the food be very good .
love the soup .
the new italian kid on the block
another italian restaurant in Collingswood ?
do we need another one ?
only if it be of the quality of that be Amore .
the menu have the usual but then they step it up another notch .
the arancini di riso ( risotto fritter ) be not to be miss .
chicken saltimboca be excellent and then there be the chocolate mousse that come straight from heaven .
pay extra attention to the appetizer - the next time I go there I be plan on order a few instead of a entree .
Auto Towing be one of the best towing service I have use .
the first time I use they they arrive on time and tow car for I to the destination I need .
the auto mechanic that work for Auto Towing be very friendly and informative and answer any question I have .
they have tow car for I a few time and I be always very satisfied with this service .
if you be look for towing service that can offer you a good tow car service , then Auto Towing be the company for you .
a very satisfied new customer !
as a very satisfied new customer , I wholeheartedly recommend United Air Duct Cleaning .
not only be my wife and I very pleased , but I also have the air duct quality test professionally by the home inspector that I regularly use , before and after United Air Duct perform they work .
base on the test result , the home inspector state that the quality of they job be " excellent " .
the best breakfast in Solana Beach !
we love T 's Cafe !
without a doubt the best place to grab a tall bloody mary and some egg benedict .
T 's have be a North County landmark for thirty year and with good reason .
family own and operate make sure the atmosphere be relaxed and the food home - cook with style .
I highly recommend pick up a jug of they homemade bloody mary mix - definitely the best .
if you have be to North County , chance be it be in you favorite list already .
Prominent Builders NJ
prominent builder in New Jersey be one the best building contractor , I be refer to they by my friend , I be so glad I use they for my home renovation , and addition .

great dude cut !
great service , cool vibe , impeccable style .
I be a guy with tricky hair so get that right be job # 1 .

look like there be a lot of talent in this place .
worth every penny .
my favorite place at Wildwood
I have be go to the Wildwood , NJ for over 30 year for summer vacation and always call the Madrid first .
I rate it 5 star .
I be not say it be a 5 star hotel .
we prefer the layout of room and it be always clean .
when in Scordia , Sicily
if ever in Sicily please take the time to visit Anna Maria Jose Mudo and she familia .
you will also have the pleasure of learn the Italiano language .
you will also have the experience of learn the bella sicilian culture , that I have fall in love with .
I will for - ever be eternally grateful for they hospitality and love that my sicilian family show I when I be there for 3 year .

I have never feel the need to write a review or make a complaint before , but after the way I be speak to by a member of staff at the kennel ( whose name I believe to be Mrs Closs ) I would now not recommend this business to anybody .
if the animal be treat in the same way the customer be treat then this leave a lot to be desire !
nobody should be speak to like that regardless of how bad they day may have be or what may be go on in they private life !
best car dealer in TX
I purchase a nissan from this dealship .
the sale man be very knowledgeable about every aspect of every car we look at .
they be very patient and helpful from show the car to do the paperwork .
the paperwork be a very easy and smooth .
overall , I be very happy with the customer service and my purchase .
if you be look to buy a car , definitely give they a call .
they have a huge inventory .
I have be a patient at NW hospital and it be great .
yes , we have to wait , but er be a triage system that take the most life threaten case first .
any er would be the same .
as far as be treat like a drug seeker , that have not be my experience .
as a nurse I know about drug seeker .
this be a great hospital and even better since it become part of the UW system .
I have immense pain on a Sunday morning , with friend and family tell I that I would never find a dentist on a Sunday .
Dr. Taylor be not only available on a Sunday , but also be able to immediately take care of I .
he be incredibly informative about the option I have , give I opinion on different treatment to choose from .
come from a person who hate the dentist in general , Dr. Taylor be the best !
he really make the visit a pain free one with excellent service !
I would recommend he to everyone !
this school be the worst one i have ever be to .
I attend it for 2 year , and that be enough .
there be hole everywhere in the ceiling , sewage constantly leak through the ceiling , and the whole condition of the school be horrible .
the staff and the principal be rediculous , they do not listen to any input , and they make up rediculous rule ( they ban backpack , because a teacher trip over a student 's ) .
the education be horrible at best , do society a favor , and do not send you student here .
excellent customer service and quality work .
they go the extra mile to repair my cowboy boot -- they have to have a special kind of paper that look like wood grain to fix the heel .
that be 4 year ago .
( I have be through at least 5 place already . )
if I have time to drive to Tacoma before they close during the work week , I would just so I could get those boot fix properly again .
so handy for local La Jolla Stuff - especially for find residential number
since move back from college and try to settle root in the Village , I have refer to the La Jolla Blue Book for a ton of local number .
the white page allow I to get in touch with parent of my high school friend so that I could track people down one by one and the restaurant section be basically my cookbook .
it be really cool that so many local business be find so quickly in one place and I want to spread the word .
the staff do occasionally get game info correct , but if you be look for a good game and be not a nerd , do not ask they .
the last time I do that I be suggest to buy oblivion when I tell they I be look for a fps .
I know what it be and tell the guy that it be not a fps .
overall they be not very knowledge about the type of game be on the market .
first and last time we will eat there
my friend and I go there for lunch today .
neither one of we have ever be - so we think we would try it .
big mistake - the food be tasteless and cold .
we both keep try to find something we like .
the only thing I find edible be the potato wedge , I finally give up , he keep try - he find the fry wanton to be ok - he mongolian bowl be awful .
would not recommend this place to anyone - in fact - save you money and go somewhere else .
liquidweb.com rock !!!

great price , great service !
I have be to this shop twice ( once for a inspection and again for a oil change ) and they truly live up to they name : Discount !
they have all kind of coupon available for car wash , oil change , state inspection , etc .
the thing be , you still get high quality service at nicely discounted rate !
there be even free coffee and bottle of water if you would like .
the owner be a pleasant guy and I would trust my car with he or any of he worker .
top notch , all the way !
David be amazing
David be the most helpful and creative photographer that I have use .
he be willing to do whatever you need from he without hesitation .
he be patient and adapt when everything do not go accord to schedule on my wedding day .
he get the picture back to I quickly .
I would highly recommend David to anyone .
he will exceed you expectation !
he do not just take picture he make art out of they and you will not even notice that there be a camera there .
not so great
my husband just get a bike there as a gift he be only have it a month .
it be a nice bike and it cost a lot of money .
but just this week a peddle break .
he take it back and they would not honor a warranty and say it be he fault because of he shoe ??
so they be go to charge he for new peddle and proceed to put they on without even tell he the price .
which be very expensive .
he ask for a different pair instead and they only give he five dollar off ??
Trek be not so great
only concerned with money
I have be get my treatment for a few month now and have see some result but not up to the standard that I be tell I should expect .
the people there attempt to come across as professional and nice , but I be disappointed with they customer service .
never miss a appointment because they will charge you the price of a treatment , even if you have a emergency .
it be pretty ridiculous !
they do not care one bit about you !!!!!
terrible service !!!
make a appointment to have they come to the house to discuss curtain option and give a estimate .
they send over someone who say he know nothing about curtain and could not show I fabric option or give a estimate .
when I call the manager to complain , she say she know the guy do not know about curtain and that the usual lady call in sick hour earlier !
instead of reschedule they choose to waste my time instead .
so what be the point of the appointment !?!
to just come over and hang out ?!?
I will never do business with this company !
internet department be rude and insulting
I be look to bring a customer to they lot to buy a car but the internet salesperson last name be Balazick send I this email " and if it be worth my time I would have bother aswer you question .
I make money not deal with broker " wow , can you believe in today 's tough time this dealership would be look for any way to move vehicle .
as a previous internet manager I would deal with anyone look to buy a car for a profit and not care if they come in with a broker .
stay away from this dealership !!!
this place be a rip - off
I bring a car in to have the " check engine " light diagnose back in March of 2010 .
they say it be " plug and wire " and quote I $ 330 to do the work , include part .
I ask why so high and they say it be due to the labor of move thing out of the way .
those thing end up be a windsheild washer fluid tank ( 1 screw ) and the air filter canister ( 4 spring clip ) .
I do the work myself for $ 50 .
there be no excuse for that kind of estimate .
my girlfriend and I take a chance on this place because we do not want to wait in line at Outback .
what a amazing find - this restaurant be a gem .
# 1 it be immaculately clean .
# 2 the decor be tasteful and artistic , from the comfortable chair to the elegant light fixture .... and ( most importantly ) # 3 the food be fantastic .
this be authentic cuban cuisine ; fresh ingredient expertly prepare and season perfectly .
the portion be generous and we get out for less than the cost of one entree at some chain restaurant .
try this place - you will love it .
thank you for help I get more healthy !
I come in and see Dr. Ruona about a month ago for quit smoking .
I have to tell you that I have not have one and do not want one .
it be the easiest thing that I have ever do and I tell all my friend that they should do it too .
I send a customer of mine to you .
Dr. Ruona , if you read this , thank you for help I get more healthy .
I can not thank you enough .

fantastic for kid
if you have child or be just a real animal lover yourself you will love this zoo .
it be only $ 10 and in essence just one big petting zoo .
they sell feed and milk bottle at the front and I recommend you buy lot .
the animal be all very sweet and patient with she .
among the animal that be available to touch be pony' , camel and even a ostrich !!!
wonderful , inexpensive and lot of fun !
I can not say enough good thing about Karla and the wonderful thing she have do for I and my dog Gracee .
she have always be there for Gracee even for last minute call !
she have take care of my sweet girl for almost 4 year now and I would not let Gracee go with anyone besides she !!!
she be caring , punctual , and very enthusiastic about she job !
you should give she a try - it be worth every penny to know that you pet be in great hand with Wunderbar pet sitting !!!!
worst service I have ever experience
I wish there be something good to say about the business , but unfortunately , there be not .
1 ) service and manners be nonexistent .
2 ) the employee constantly talk down to customer and be very argumentative for the sake of be argumentative .
( to both myself and customer ) 3 ) I have never experience so much rudeness come from a business .
4 ) the business be very unorganized .
the invoice be not detailed , so it be difficult to see what you be pay for .
I would recommend to save you time and energy and find another greek store .
Exile be the best !!!
Exile be the longest last and most authentic punk store in Richmond !
I have be shop there for over six year now .
the staff be incredibly friendly and helpful and the owner , Mimmy , be a absolute angel .
the mark up be minimal consider that the clothing be hard to find and often ship for Europe .
Exile be environmentally conscious and involved heavily in we community .
shop local at Exile !!
Buddakan inevitably attract the majority of its guest simply because of its association with Steven Starr , but that do not impress I .
the atmosphere alone deserve 4 star but , the food be not up to par with the price tag and the reputation the restaurant carry .
the angry lobster be completely over-priced !
$ 80 for a dish that have about one small lobster tail and be full of filler vegetable !
I would not go there again .
Alto deliver on all level .
from the moment you enter the restaurant , you know you be some place special .
the service be impeccable , and the food be even better .
I highly recommend the four - course tasting menu , which give you plenty of range and food to satisfy you appetite .
while it be not cheap , Alto will give you a experience you will never forget .
the landlord be not nice nor helpful
I have live in Buckingham Condominiums townhouse for 2 year .
I love the location and the apartment !!
I be a single female and I feel safe come home at night .
the maintenance people be awesome !!!!
and the exterminator be very nice , also .
yes , you still have a few bug , but that be go to be anywhere you go !
the only problem that I have experience be the landlord .
she be a pure b**** !!!
other than that , I would recommend live here . :)
the staff leave a lot to be desire .
the front staff have see quite a bit of turnover and change from professional to rude .
a simple follow - up phone call with a woman quickly turn into a nightmare .
she may be the reason for all the change .
I sincerely wonder if the doctor have a clue about what be go on within he practice .
if he do know and approve of this behavior then it be a poor reflection on he .
sometimes it be not worth it to go through that kind of staff and they personal attitude to get to a doctor .
he be a okay doctor but not worth she .
WWW - wonderful wild Wildernest inn
I would give the Wildernest inn ten star of five !
atop Spring Mountain , from the deck of the West porch , " one can see forever " a scene of unparalleled beauty and grandeur .
I see deer frequently , in fact a small herd be graze near the lodge .
there be occasional bear on the deck in the morning .
and most correctly , we visitor do not mingle with the native wildlife .
it would have be more than one could bear !
Kathy and Stewart , the proprietor be the epitome of perfection .
delightful , hospitable , superb , cozy and comfortable .
I hope to be back !
junkie lube ?!
really weird place , I be drive home from work think I would stop in for a oil change and well , there be a few guy in jiffy lube uniform sit at the table drink beer and shoot the breeze .
the neon lighting sign still say " on " yet some guy who seem to be the oldest of the bunch , more like the drunkest of the bunch tell I they would be open tomorrow .
I ask if a manager be on duty he tell I he be .
grey shirt " mark " of course with this type behavior he could have be wear someon else 's clothing .....
it be not the classiest place , but it be cleaner than I expect and the staff be very friendly .
for $ 4 it be a nice break from the monotony of winter indoors with a toddler .
restore my faith in mechainc .
I spend 3 month go from shop to shop try to get my Ferrari to run and drive the way it should .
they take on the challenge of make my Ferrari all I dream of and more .
the crew at the Creative Workshop go over and above the call of duty and give I back a car I can drive anywhere and finally enjoy own .
I can not say enough about this place .
they have restore my faith in mechanic .
do yourself a favor , call these guy first and enjoy drive you car again ..
a great vacation !
we want to see the sun - and we also get much more !
after a train ride over the mountain , we enjoy hike in the flower - fill Wenatchee hill ( in May ) and a very interesting bike ride in a loop around the Columbia River ... and then wine if we want it on the patio in the evening ....
this be a busy group of host they be also run a restaurant , which also must be wonderful - so just ask for what you need , and I be sure they will do they best to be hospitable .
omg .. make sure to book a reservation , as this magical place be packed ( in a nice way ) I love that the owner walk around and care how he customer feel about they food .
the waiter be like no other ...
my waiter be so excellent I give he a 75 % tip , and it be worht every penny ..
the food be finger lick the bowel fantastic ..
I just discover she have a place right near my work ( color I phat ) if you be look for a romatic place with the best food and service in the valley Giovanni Ristorante should be you number 1 + 2 choice .
Holly be truely the best hairstylist !
I have live in the UTC La Jolla area for many year , and I never new this salon be here until a friend refer I to see Holly here .
I be very pleased with my experience here .
all of the people be friendly and welcoming .
I get highlight , haircut , and a blowdry .
she do a great job !
holly be very experienced and talented , and I could tell she new what she be do right off the bat .
my hair look amazing , and I get compliment all the time .
I deffenitly reccomend this salon and Holly to anyone .
you will not be disappoint !!!!!!
outdated but not bad
so I really feel like this place be extremely outdated especially since the picture make it look nice and modern .
it have list that there be a hot breakfast but all this mean be that they add a waffle maker to the common continental affair at most cheap hotel .
the family suite be basically two room with a small opening between they which work great for we because we be two family travel together .
if you be in town and need that kind of space I say stay here but if you be look for a little more upscale affair do not let the picture fool you and book somewhere else .
great , and probably the only west indian spot worth hit up in Nashville .
I be bear and raise in Toronto , which have a huge west indian ( trinidadian , jamaican , etc ) population .
anyway , I be practically raise on this stuff , and be a connoisseur of west indian cuisine , Jamaica Way be a bit tone down to suit the american palette .
all you have to do to make it authentic jamaican food , be add a whole lot of pepper .
a lot .
the finest Christmas tree i have ever see .
I feel like I be in heaven when I walk through the majestic field of this particular farm .
the tree be in magnificent shape and the variety be astounding .
the owner be entertaining and gracious .
I especially like the eco friendly atmosphere and the owner 's love of all animal .
this be one of the best farm I have ever be to .
I would call it the Taj Mahal of the east coast !
it put hair on my chest and thanks to the owner 's advice I invest vanguard , get myself a woman like Jerry , and become a republican .
thanks Tussey Mountain Tree Plantation !
pho - nomenal !!
I have be eat pho for almost my entire life and I have always go to the pho place in south philly and off the boulevard and even the other one in chinatown , but when i try this pho place , it blow the other pho house away !!
all of the pho place taste the same to I , so what seperate one from the other be the service and the price .
the service here be incredible compare to the other place .
the only down fall of this pho house be the difficulty in find parking in chinatown .
remember to bring cash since they do not take debit or credit .
hope this help !!
I be not interested in shop in a place with people like she ... she refuse to sell I the item at its mark price even after admit they have make a mistake .
I normally do not write review but see that I consider Dillards a distinguished , upscale place to shop , this one will not be get my business , nor my family 's , nor my co-worker .
it be never ok to let a customer walk out unhappy , especially when they be right .
I work as a transformational life coach .
since this be a alternative therapy I always refer client to a lisenced therapist when I feel that be appropriate .
I find she through a colleague one day when one of my client be in the midst of a panic attack and need professional help that I be not qualified to provide .
little do I know that I would soon be need she help as well !
she guide I through a very difficult period deal with a family member 's suicide , couple with elder abuse .
I find she to be extremely solid , kind , compassionate , and intuitive as well .
I would recommend she highly !
they will not have a second chance from I .
first , let I state that although I live in NYC , I be not from NYC , I do not care about baseball and I absolutely love Boston to death ( so beautiful , so clean , so awesome ) .
that say , I hate this restaurant .
the service be just about as good as I would get in NYC ( that mean it be poor ) and the food be almost mediocre .
the decor leave a lot to be desire and the poster tell I all the reason 99 be great just serve as a ironic contrast against the reality .
personally I recommend you take you money elsewhere
when I arrive at Brickell Honda on 6/4/11 , I be greet and attend to by the sale manager , Gustavo Guerra , in a very friendly and professional manner .
I explain to he what I want and that I previously go to Braman Honda .
Bramen Honda be a bit of a hassle .
he tell I " no problem , we will match the offer or do better . "
Mr. Guerra give I a better deal without any hassle nor any type of problem .
Brickell Honda have be the best buying experience in the world .
I urge all St. Thomas the Apostle parishioner and all of south Florida resident to come see Gus !!!
excellent customer service !!!
great , honest service
I take my 2001 Nissan Frontier in to fix a crack manifold .
the dealer want $ 1300 to fix that and another $ 1500 to fix some other thing .
Eagle Transmission determine that much of the work the dealer say need to be do be unneccesary and what need to be fix be only $ 400 !!
I be so impressed with the honesty and integrity of Mike and everyone at Eagle Transmission !
I drop the truck off in the morning and it be ready that afternoon .
I have finally find a mechanic I trust !!
and it be great that they do not charge a service fee to diagnose the problem - a add bonus !!
Kelly hit the nail on the head .
" Dr. Shady " be a jerk .
after the way she speak to I on my last visit , I will not be return !!
good luck keep business with that stick up attitude Dr. Shady .
you have just lose mine .
the next time you feel like be condescending to someone , it be not go to be I !!!!!!
Dr. Shady be inexperienced and prideful .
she probably do not even have 10 % of the knowledge that some of the other experienced vet do in this area .
I will be carefully research vet before I take my dog someplace else .
beautifully write review Doctor , but completely untrue .
I do not have a good experience with / Dr. Ghassemlou .
during the session , he demand to have my physical address , which I have always keep private as I be enrol in a witness protection program .
I believe he be correct in that he need my physical address for legal reason , however , he do not adequately explain this during we session .
I learn more about this do my own research afterward .
I think he could have do more to assuage my concern by give I concrete fact .
say that I need to give he my address or else I have intimacy issue be not helpful .
it be pretty combative actually .
you will love it
I have have my back fuse in 2 place .
I wish that I have not do this .
with these fusion , chiropractric be not as successful , but it still be very helpful .
even after my fusion , my back continue to hurt , but now it do not hurt any more .
I would encourage anyone who be think of back surgery , to talk about different treatment option first with Dr. de Barros .
you can see different treatment that a surgeon can not see , so that you can have several treatment option before you decide what to do .
unbelievably huge experience for such a small salon !!!
I have be to Kim at Cheveux for more than five year .
I can not tell you how often I be compliment on my hair ( style and color ) !
I regularly request Kim 's business card as I be often stop on the street and ask " who do you hair ... I love it !!! "
quaint , lovely , small salon with big personality .
I be make to feel special when I be in the chair and I have never have a less than amazing cut or color experience .
my hair have never feel this healthy , either .
I can not recommend this salon enough !!!
thanks Cheveux !
my favorite in McLean
my family love come to Endo Sushi . they be very nice , it be never crowded , and the food be wonderful , very delicious and fresh !
sometimes it be hard to get parking in the lot in front of the storefront , and it be on a one - way street , but the restaurant itself be never overcrowded .
if you can not park in the lot , then you can park in the shopping center 's garage , and walk up to Endo Sushi .
the service be fast .
be sure to ring the little bell on you way out if you enjoy you meal !
( it be by the door , on the hostess stand )
horrible service !
I explain that i be already on my way and i would rush to get there as soon as i could because i need my car for work at 5 am , but the guy be argue with I say he be go to lock the door right at 5:30 .
rude , unprofessional , just jerk .
seem like all they care about be the money and get home on time , no care for the customer at all !!!
miss a whole day of work because i be now carless .
I will neeeeeeeeeverrrr go to this place again .
I use Fancy Flowers for my late husband 's funeral flower as they have be recommend to I .
I be so glad that I call in to see Ana , she be a lovely girl who show nothing but care and compassion towards I .
the flower be all that I hope they would be , I have attend several funeral of late unfortunately and the flower I recieve from Ana outshine they all .
she be so talented , the flower be arrange superbly and delicately , it be so obvious to see the difference between someone fully trained and skilled compare to other .
thank you Ana I hope to see you in the future under better circumstance .
great first experience .
I be 22 , and my hairdresser be great ( and not " old " like one of the reviews say ) - she really listen to what I want and give I ton of tip on how to style my hair so I could get it to look the way I want it to .
she deep condition my hair and take the time to style it properly .
she recommend product but absolutely do not pressure I to buy .
it be a cute place with a really friendly , laid - back atmosphere .
I would highly recommend it and will be go back for my next haircut .
and student get $ 5 off , can not argue with that .
smoker 's haven
yeah , this complex be not very good .
we bathroom fan , one electric outlet and 2 leaky sink have yet to be fix .
both bathroom look like they be flood and the wood cabinet be thrash at the bottom and they slap some piece of wood over to try to cover it up .
and non-smoker beware !!!
I think 90 percent of the tenant be smoker !
if you do not smoke , do not move here .
we unit reek of old cigarette smoke and it start to become apparent a few week after we move in .
you can not walk 5 foot without smell that disgusting cigarette smoke and it blow right into the window all day and all night .
great sanwich , great price
I use to go here almost every day since I work in the neighbourhood and love they turkey and meatball sandwich .
Chicken salad salad be great too .
best of all , the staff be quick on they feet and even with long line , usually serve you in 5 minute or less .
for the quality , the price ( $ 4 - $ 6 ) have to be the best in town .
the staff get to know regular and do they job very well .
tourist like the other reviewer might not appreciate they efficiency or quality , but I certainly do .
this be not a TGIF or Cafe , it be a lunch sandwich place and a good one at that .
rate a church ?
might as well just hotpot the curb and rate the traffic light .
it be a bloody church , for chrisssake !
big , grey and imposing .
go there on christian holiday for a bit of churchy grandure .
the pastor at this church be cool , I meet he after some holiday service .
he have a robe that be make back in the '60 .
God be pleased with that one !
it be historical for Sf , so when you aunte come for a visit , take she there .
stop by at least once or you will go to heck !
ok but just because we were on a tight budget .
I and my dad were in NJ for a kc chiefs ( my home team ) versus the NY jets and for game 4 of the world series .
i be a red sox fan so i be glad that the phillies win .
the knights inn be small very small . i mean 1 room in every room ! it be cozy a little and a small tv .
i mean a 2 day stay be a ok stay even though the manager look like he be Chinese and that we only sleep and go out from 8 to 7 to see New York .
but since we almost just sleep there i can not give that good of a review
it be a Saturday and my spring be broken ...
I google garage door repair in Woodinville and find NDI - Johnette answer the phone and be oh - so pleasant and helpful !
she sort of appologize for Dan take the day off to go ski - but he could do the repair on Sunday !
I say great and Dan arrive on time at 10 am to make the repair .
I enjoy speak with Dan , and learn more about how the spring be size for these door .
the repair go quickly and the price be extremely fair .
I would highly recommend NDI - and will spread the word to my neighbor .
thanks Dan and Johnette for you responsiveness and professional service .
Roger M. , Woodinville
I would not send my dog there .
I have a conversation with the woman run this place in April 2010 .
she basically say if the child get off the bus be not pay to enter she building she be go to let they wander around the street .
wow , really ?
with all the child predator out there , a busy road , car speed by ...... and you be go to let some 4 / 5 year old wonder around cause you be money hungry ?
real christian of you !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
whether they pay I or not , if they parent get into a accident , stuck in traffic , etc. the last thing I would do be let a child get rape because I be not pay .
I could easily go to Nordstrom for my designer jeans and pay the same price , but I go to the Garment District for they service .
previous reviewer say they be pushy and I can understand that , but I find the staff more helpful than anything else .
Tiffany be fabulous !
I come in for alteration ( free , by the way ) and tell she about a stain I have on my new leather purse .
she immediately go to the back , bring out leather cleaner and clean my purse on the spot .
I do not even buy the bag there !
huge selection and , great suggestion from the staff and they refer you to reliable place if they do not have what you need .
we be expect a great experience , when we recieve a friendly greeting by the host .
the atmosphere be nice and very clean .
the menu have plenty of option even for picky eater .
the service be ok , we waitress keep forget we drink even though we remind she several time .
to start we try the guacamole and salsa verde , it be completly flavorless .
we should have leave then .
we orderd we meal anyway , chimichanga , jalapeno borrito , and quesadilla .
everything be bland , completely void of any spice or flavor .
we have never have mexican food this bad , it be just simply gross .
hopefully they spice thing up or they will not be in business long .
I recommend La Hacienda
might try again
do not know where else you can find purple hull pea and some of the other side .
half the table and bar be empty by this point .
other thought : will try this place again .
there must be a reason so many people like it there .
very professional / very helpful
the people at Fidelity Leasing be very friendly and helpful .
i be look for a car but do not really know what i want and they be very helpful and take the time to first figure out what my need be and show I various option to meet those need .
they seem more interested in help I find the right car rather than just make a sale .
my experience with they be great - low stress , very helpful and very personal .
from start to finish they be top notch .
i would highly recommend call these people up for you next car .
this insurance co. be a joke !!!
they have absolutely no communication skill whatsoever .
if you do not mind be rob , cheat or lie to then this be the company for you .
they will make every attempt to misinform and misrepresent themselves .
they make up excuse in hope to confuse they policy holder with misinformation .
as a example they take payment for 5 out of 6 monthly plan premium for a yearly policy and cancel the contract for the remainder of the policy for reason they state be not receive information on other license driver in the household ?
I personally provide the request on four separate occasion and they claim there be a glitch in they system ?
Ifa be a acronym for I be a fucking asshole !!!
fantastic service !
I have be here a few time for oil change and just get my tire , alignment and state inspection do yesterday .
I shop it around and they be extremely competitive in pricing and also add nitrogen to my tire which should extend the life and get I better gas mileage .
it also come with free balance and rotation for the life of the tire !
what make it perfect be that they offer transportation so that I would not have to wait there or take time off of work to go back and forth or try to find a ride .
great service , great pricing and super convenient !
I also do not feel like they try to sell I a bunch of service that I do not need .
love my home at Creekside
I move to Creekside Apartments in August 2008 with a 6 - month lease and have just extend it for another 13 month !
the management from Julie and Janice to the work staff , esp. Edwin , be just wonderful .
they have be extremely helpful whenever I have ask for help .
although the apartment be face Stokes Street and close to the Bascom Light Rail , the location be surprisingly quiet .
I have never have any problem with loud neighbor or concern about safety .
the apartment be within walking distance to Trader Joe 's , Whole Foods , and other store .
the well - equip , clean gym be a plus !
great place to live if you work in and around downtown San Jose !
I interview several contractor for a kitchen remodel .
Liberty construction show up and it be two guy ... all I get be 100 % sale pitch " we be the best ... we be number 50 so we must be do something right ... look at all these certificate that say we be great " .
not once do I feel listen to like they actually care about what I want , all they be interested in be I sign a contract right then and there .
very high pressured sale and with the review of many other bad service .
I be glad I trust my gut and do not get suck into do business with they .
find someone you trust that actually hear you and want to do the job right .
do not waste you time or money !
I take my 3 year old son here at the weekend and to be honest , apart from the shark walkway , I think it be rubbish and overpriced .
even take into account the fact that my 3 year old want to run most of the way round , it take we just over one hour start to finish .
if you have be to the London Aquarium I would not even bother with this .
if you be really desperate for something to pass the time and be willing to shell out the best part of £ 30 for 2 two people then go for it .
( for some reason it will not let I rate it one star - it be not rate 5 by I ! )
Cranmore Dental and Implant Clinic : I could not recommend Dr David Nelson enough .
I have a severe phobia of attend the dentist until I meet and be treat by Dr Nelson .
he instantaneously put I at ease and he ongoing treatment have be absolutely pain free .
my previous apprehension have be dismiss and I no longer have a sinking feeling when my next appointment be due !
in addition to the core treatment , Dr Nelson have impress I further with he concern and interest in the well - being of he patient - he dental work underpin by a strong duty of care to every patient .
he be always prepared to go the extra mile to ensure that any patient discomfort be deal with immediately -
best salsa ( hehehe )
after my tree be clean up , they give I a jar of salsa .
the owner warn I that it be the best salsa I would ever have , and he be right .
no joke !
I hate to say check they out just for the salsa , but James , I need another jar badly :) all kidding aside , they be a very good company , I have a hard time give any service biz a 5 star review but they come close .
very affordable ( do not call it cheap ) and they trimmer be quick and courteous when I get home from work .
Dr. Mann kill we pet
yea , Dr. Mann be not so great .
we take we beloved kitty to he and it come back dead .
we live in the sub-division around the corner and after it happen and we bring it up at some neighborhood gathering we discover that several people from this neighborhood alone have pet go to Dr. Mann for surgical procedure and come back dead .
if you take he here for shot , no big deal but I would never let this man apply anesthetic to my pet ever again .
oh , they also charge I for the procedure ( $ 250 ) and have the audacity to charge I a $ 25 ' disposal ' fee .
they actually itemize it as a disposal fee .
avoid at all cost .
one of the worst place
this place and its sister store Peking Garden be the worst place to order from .
the food be horrible not cook like it should be , they get the order wrong on a number of occasion , and once forget about my order .
i have to call back up there two hour later and the lady ( who claim to be a manager ) say my food be on the way , and she do not offer to compensate I in any kind of way .
i wait another 30 min before receive my food and it be cold .
in my opinon this place should be shut down by the health inspector , and anyone who be satisfied with there service and food have never eat at a real asian restaurant .
go downhill since change in ownership
I use to love this place .
but now that they be part of a chain , service have slip .
I be wait longer at BNA for my pickup and last time I park with they , they lose my car key .
lucky I have a spare with I !
to date they have not make good by either find the key or pay for a new one .
( these new car key be expensive to copy , you can not just go to WalMart . )
go to the website for coupon and join the club - you can get free parking .
however , with BNA offer one day of free parking due to construction of the new rental car facility , it may be cheaper to park at BNA .
wife and I attempt to adopt a dog and be nothing but frustrating .
we arrive Sunday at about 230 and find a do we really like .
we be tell that we could not today because they be close soon .
I call the next morning to let then know my wife would be drive in .
they give I the run around and miss paperwork only to call back to tell I someone else want she and I would need to come in and put down a deposit .
I work 2 hour away but offer my card over the phone .
they refuse .
terrible communication as well .
at one point they tell I the dog have be fix , the next day it have not .
huge ammount of time waste time and elevate blood pressure .
college be a joke and the salon be a joke !
go to the school here over priced !!!!!!
you do not learn the thing you be promise .
you have to bring in you own model and they have to pay for you to use they if you do not then you can graduate !
go back after graduate you be tell you get a discount on service nope you do not .
staff be under educated .
go there you learn the school do not care about the service give just about the money .
over priced for student to learn !
beware of the nail program you be not teach to use a nail drill at all you learn the old fashioned way of do nail you will not be able to do well in a salon !!!
you can fool people
this store be proof that you can fool people with good advertising .
they convince lot of people that they be a great store , when in fact they be a very average place at best , they be just another big box store like the other .
they offer sale that be not really sale , mislabele item that make the item sound like a good deal when it be not , a bad attitude about return item , and on and on .
with higher than average price to boot !
so do not get take in , keep you eye open if you choose to shop here .
on the other hand , the Richmond Ukrops chain be know for its charity work , its community action , and its interest in the public welfare .
do not go here unless you want to sit , order , eat and be ask to leave all in a matter of 20 minute .
you will not even have time to read the entire menu before be ask to order and if you ask for more time you server will wait at the table .
this be the only place I have ever eat and be tell to leave because other people be wait .
I be tell to take my coffee to go if I want to finish it .
plus the drink be self service , have fun try to negotiate the small cafeteria space to get you coffee , juice or water .
go next door to the Ball Square Cafe instead .
I try to stay here for a few night with my girlfriend , so we ask for a single queen bed .
we get there , and we be treat to the free " upgrade " of a room with two double bed .
since they consider this a upgrade , they let they other room fill up and would not change we room .
then we get put in a room with a huge gap under the door .... right next to the ice machine .
we could hear every single thing that happen outside like it be inside we room .
when I finally find someone at the desk who could speak English , they move we room , but we still do not receive the single queen we have " reserve "
I be thoroughly impressed !
I have a problem with the tile in my bathroom come apart .
I call a few different business in the area to get estimate , they be not the cheapest I find but very reasonable .
the best part be I get my whole bathroom remodel for about the same price the other company be quote just to fix the shower tile and fixture .
they have the work done in about half the time quote which make I and my wife extremely happy .
we have have nothing but compliment on we bathroom when guest come over - who would have guess that one ?
very nice work and friendly guy too .
best money I have spend on remodeling ever .
I highly recommend any one consider home repair to give these guy a call .
new training centre be excellent

I purchase a 2 - year old certified pre-owned BMW from this dealership .
the night I drive back home , I find that the rear window have some leakage .
( you can hear the wind while drive on highway .
very likely it need a new window seal ) .
I admit that I should have pay attention to this kind of little thing while test driving .
( but this be a certified car from a dealer . )
so I bring the car back the second day .
they tell I that this be not under warranty and want to charge I $ 175 just to diagnose the problem !
I walk away .
so my advice be that never trust this dealer .
after I have choose the Fountain Dental Practice they provide a slick and professional service from start to finish .
everyone be friendly from the receptionist to the surgeon herself , put I at my ease and explain the whole process , both initially and then as we go along .
surgery visit timing be always make to suit I and not they and they give I the feeling that I matter and be important to they .
the surgery itself be slick , modern and very relaxed and I always feel that I be in capable hand .
my dental surgeon , Dr. Lucy Nichols be clearly a dental perfectionist and clearly proud both of the work she do and the reputation she have establish .
everyone be so helpful that I can not wait to go back .....
wonderful service for large group
I have my wedding luncheon at this BJ 's restaurant , and it be one of the best choice that I make .
it be a great deal -- we pay a certain amount per person , and my husband and I choose 4 type of pizza and the server bring out as much as we want .
we be also serve salad and soda .
we have a large party , about fifty people or so , and yet everything be serve quickly and we all have a wonderful time .
even though we be only suppose to have those specific type of pizza , when guest ask for a different type , it be bring out with no charge to we !
I really appreciate BJ 's for make that special day even better with they wonderful food and service .

after recently relocate to South Bend , we be look for a delicious , fun , yet elegant establishment for New Year 's Eve dinner .
we be disappointed with this holiday dinner due to the overall flavor and price of the meal , and accessibility to the Jazz Club .
the meal be extremely overpriced and lack flavor , especially for be a special NYE menu .
the limited menu have few appetizing option and the NYE special package be way overpriced .
after we meal , we server find we a table in the jazz club where we be inform it would be another $ 10 / person to stay and listen to the band , despite the fact we have just finish a dinner there and be intend to enjoy they drink list .
this be a less than impressive experience at Trio 's .
run for the hill ... you will be much better off !
one night be too much .
first room have use tissue next to the bed and I request it be rectify .
I be then move to another room around the back where the room be dirty , the shower be dirty with other people 's hair in it , the toilet seat be peel and rough and the bathroom be full of mould .
I call reception to ask if they know the state the room be in and be tell " this be a Days Inn , not the Hilton " and the receptionist then hang up on I .
to warn you to stay away from this place just be not enough .
there be not one ounce of caring involved and anyone I can warn about the complete lack of service will be warn .
grocery and daily need store
before use FusionRetail before install FusionRetail store be run on a dos base software .

disatisfied customer , I go through Kitchen Aid and use one of they recommend vendor .
A&E come out , charge $ 129 fee just to walk in the door .
I need a part for my appliance , the cost be very high so I say never mind , pay the fee and call a local business for a second quote .
they quote come in at half the price of A&E for the same work and same part .
seem to I like A&E charge way more than necessary !
very disappointed in Kitchen Aid as well , I think that they pre-screen they vendor for price and quality of work , obviously they do not !
Lovely Nails on Cayuga St. in Lewiston , NY
first let I start out by say , that I have have very nice pedicure at Lovely Nails on Military Road .
I be very excited that a salon be open in Lewiston , as I live in Youngstown .
I be in two week ago and have the worst pedicure that I have have in my life .
there be four of we and I be take first by a gentleman .
I put my foot in the water and it be cool .
he do warm it up .
he also hurt my toe while push my cuticle back .
if the pedicure last 20 min. , that be a stretch .
the other lady have a similar experience , both have nail polish on a couple of toe .
none of we will be use they service again , which be a shame .
good service - limited result

I have a sampler of ipa , Brawler , Love Stout & esa .
all be awesome , & I have a dogwood grill cheese which be enjoyable with the fine beer .
if you be in Philly you have to come check this place out !
the only negative I have about this place be the parking !
I leave with a case of BRAWLER !!!! !
oil change disaster
my wife have take she '07 Ford Fusion in for a routine oil change .
a couple day after the oil change , the engine run rough , the low oil pressure light would come on sporadically , and the engine would whir loudly .
turn out the engine have no oil , and when oil be put in , it would just run out of the filter .
there could have ( hopefully do not have ) major damage to the engine .
all of this start after they oil change .
once they realize they mistake they send a mechanic and tow truck to my wife 's work and tow it back to fix it .
liar , negative star !
take my Cruze in twice for poor fuel economy .
the first time they claim to get reasonable mpg .
however , they would never drive the car with I in it to prove they finding .
I wonder if they be go down a hill !
they tell I to bring it back after 5000 mile .
I bring it back with 9000 mile .
they " finish " the work and tell I the car be ready .
I find out they do not even drive the car , state they look at it before .
they still would not drive the car with I to show they mpg number .
they also claim not to see anything wrong with the blower fan ( a seperate issue ) , but when I drive the car home I have the same symptom .
I will never purchace another vehicle from Vic Canever .
I want to say that Mike do a great job for we family in we time of need .
both my grandparent pass away 4 month apart and Mike be very understanding .
he be very professional in he position as a director and yet he still make time to be compassionate for what we be all go through .
I be sure it be not every day that a funeral director see the same family in such a short time .
my grandfather pass away silently in he sleep , and my grandmother pass away after a short struggle with cancer .
thank you Mike for all you help professionally and personally .
the Peterson family
if you like the drama describe in popular sitcom ' Seinfeld ' , you will see it here .
we sign we name in about 6:00 pm .
there be 3 name before we .
the greeter say there be about 15 minute waiting .
however , we wait and wait and in the mean time , see 4 group of people simply just parade in without sign there name .
this sign in policy be post by the restaurant " no reservation , sign you name here " .
I have to ask the greeter , he explain he reason with broken English .
I could not understand any he reason .
I could only take it as they would seat the people they know first .
my conclusion be that you should only go there if you want to wait at least a hour and see all kind other people be seat before you .
instructor never show up !
January 15th -- we be sign up for Saturday 's 2 pm class " beginning yoga with Brittany . "
we even arrive 10 minute early as the website suggest .
the instructor do not show up !
we wait until 2:25 pm and then leave .
well , not much I can say except I be very disappointed with this experience .
this be we first visit to you studio .
in today 's instant world , there be no reason for the instructor not to even have give we a phone call or e-mail if she be go to be late .
as a yoga studio , I be sure you be all aware that all action generate karma .
and sometimes karma can manifest itself on a bad review on Google .
I beg to differ .
this place be marginal at best .
not very welcoming and focus mostly on keep little kid entertained .
I be not impressed , and quite frustrated at they lack of rating for they course .
I understand not want to put label like 5.10 on a indoor course , because yes , it be not the same , but some clear understanding of the difficulty of one course to another be nice when you be a intermediate climber look to improve .
I do not want to waste my time on route set for child , but I do not want to take on something I can not handle just to strain myself to exhaustion .
again , a great outing for the kid , a frustration for a out of town climber .
best dj' in town !
these guy be the best .
they be thorough , high class , and go above and beyond .
we never have to worry about a thing , and they lead the way the whole time .
have a team be the best because they keep the flow of the wedding go the whole time !
they may look young but do not let that fool you , as they knowledge of music far surpass what we expect .
I be a music junkie that grow up in the 80' , and my dad work for a record label in the 1960' .
so we do not expect they to even know some of the request that we ask that night .
they just really know they stuff !
never fear go to the dentist again !
I be 61 year old and have dental problem my entire life .
by the age of 24 I stop go to the dentist .
my fear and discomfort from dental work scare I !
it take all the courage I could muster to make a appointment .
at the front door of he office , I nearly turn around .
I consider just leave after go inside and nearly do .
Doctor Gonzales and he entire staff be the most professional people I have ever deal with .
they make I feel confident in what they would do , and treat I like a member of they own family .
I never feel pain or discomfort .
the ability to smile and eat again can only be describe as a whole new lease on life .
thank you Doctor Gonzales , Doctor Stout , Eva Marie and the entire staff !

horrible service and food
not only be this place too expensive for what it be , it be horrible !
it take over 1.5 hour for we food to come out and by that time my 8 month old have it !
do it seriously take that long for a soup and salad ?
I be a waitress for year and a key rule be to serve customer with small child before other , as I be the last to get my food .
I would not recommend have a party here or even go here .
Texas Roadhouse be way better !!
spay and neuter service .
I have no doubt that the rescue be wonderful .
my vet even say it be not my fault it be the vet that do the surgery , so I would not recommend get that program unless you have a extra hundred dollar or so for antibiotic and a vet visit .
you would think they would do a good job but they do not care unless they be get pay full price .
which be so dumb .
not to mention the fact that they give we we cat back not even 30 minute after they be out from surgery .
billing issue ...
I have a routine surgery for a ingrown toenail .
my insurance company , Blue Cross / Blue Shield pay the fee and everything be fine .
then I get a bill for $ 483.00 .
the doctor 's office say that payment have be " reverse " .
Blue cross have no record of a reversal .
the office refuse my request to see what they get from BC / BS .
they eventually turn it over to a collection agency and now will not even discuss the matter .
I eventually decide to just pay the balance even though the doctor have already be pay , but now the collection agency be try to say another reversal of $ 160.00 have come through .
it be a ingrown toenail .
how much could it possibly cost ?
not only be I be bilk for money I do not owe , the office staff be rude to boot .
I think this office have some serious billing practice issue !
we have be bless to find Elite Flyers online and would not use anyone else to handle we postcard , poster , etc .
we be look for a company with decent rate as we company be just get start .
they have the best rate and great customer service .
on one order , we need it rush and ship to a different state .
they do that with no problem .
I also appreciate they honesty .
I send a graphic that would have be distort if print as it be .
they call and work with I to fix it so that it would look perfect .
they recently surprise I a larger order .
I order 1000 postcard , we normally order 5000 or more .
because they have room to do 5000 , they create the larger amount , and ship they early .
I recommend this company to anyone and everyone that need great work do at a reasonable rate !
they have a customer for life in we !
i make the mistake of buy from these thief .
I pay 2 k cash for a truck with a blow motor .
they so call mechanic say the engine be good and " there be nothing mechanicly wrong with this truck " .
well I think a blow engine fall under the category of mechanics right ?
anyway they jimmy rig it so i could drive it home .
the next day i take it to 2 auto shop and they both tell I the same thing , engine be junk .
I call and get the same runaround on hold and noone call you back .
from a moral standpoint , you guy be really go to take 2,000 buck from someone that need that truck to work and support he family when you know it be just a piece of scrap metal ?
if it last 1 month i could suck it up but 1 day ?
grimy work you guy do .
buy you kid somethin nice with my 2 k buck .
best stationery store in Bethesda
Papeluna , a cute Mom / Pop custom printing and paper store , just open a few day ago .
it be right on the hustle and bustle of Wisconsin Ave but some might miss it as it be nestle in between Subway Sandwiches and Modell 's .
I pop in after my afternoon pumpkin spice latte break at Starbucks .
it be a adorable little store fill with lot of stationery goodness .
card , wrapping paper , paper , and a area to sit down and talk with someone to design you own invitation or for whatever else you custom printing need may be .
I end up buy a birthday card and would probably come back for more .
printing , printing , copy , printing , copy , print ,
watch out for you wallet
watch out for you wallet !
this company be overpriced for they service .
they pride themselves on be a event and team building company for corporate client but you better believe they be go to mark you up on that feel good premise .
on a recent event quote that I have do , they come in thousand of dollar over they local competition .
I have speak to vendor who be use by they who have nothing good to say about the company as well and in fact be afraid to quote event against they even though they openly admit that they feel Canadian Outback be price they entertainment out of the market and do more to hurt they business than help they .
be warn - they will ltake you for everything they can .
believe I .
this be the premier university in Virginia .
it be also the largest .
with a Pizza Hut , IHOP , 3 Starbucks , Chili 's , Panera , and Chipotle on campus alone , VCU have some of the best eating option for student .
VCU have the # 1 art school in America , and excel in healthcare and medical schooling .
the Rams , the VCU sport team , also make the NCAA final 4 this year , too !
VCU also offer high - rise living for student and professor , and the historic yet fix - up house in the fan be also available to student , professor , or even people want to live in a safe , viable community .
VCU be also minute from downtown Richmond , Canal Walk , Carytown , Stony Point , Short Pump , and the VCU Medical Center .
it be the best university in Virginia and continuously receive rave review every year .
the U of R be also recommend , too !
Orr be a nightmare !
do not go !
my boyfriend and I be wake up in the middle of the night at we campsite by drunken kid who have arrive around 1:00 am and be drink at the spring .
when we complain to the management ( as we be instruct to do if there be any problem ) , nothing happen !
then , the next morning , when we , among many other irate guest , ask to speak to the owner , he refuse to do so .
not only that , but he tell we , via he manager , that it be we responsibility to get up a second time in the middle of the night and call the night staff if the problem continue , even though he manager do nothing the first time to stop the kid .
Orr be not relaxing , it be not a safe space , and the owner be awful .
to add insult to injury , he refuse to refund we money .
do not go !
FHS be a good high school -- class / of 1998
I enjoy my time at Franklin High School .
now , of course , there be a new building , with presumably better facility .
all to the good .
for those who care , a good proportion of the my class go on to 4 - year college , many of they rank in the top 50 of US News .
if I remember , student go to Dartmouth , U. Penn , Duke , BU , William and Mary , Vassar , Howard , and Carnegie Mellon , among other .
many student go to Rutgers , include they top - rank pharmacy program .
the point be -- FHS give you the opportunity to make it to a good college , but you need to work hard .
absolutely the best little motel on the coast !
I have stay at this fabulous little motel two year run , and I have to say it be one of the best lodging experience I have ever have on the coast ... and I be even compare it to the big resort I have stay at !
a large group of my friend and I rent almost the whole motel every year for a weekend , and the experience and stay have always be five - star .
there be a restaurant nearby ( walking distance ) with a great breakfast , and a market across the street .
the motel be very well maintain , and the manager be so accomodating , it be kind of like visit family each year ! ;-)
I honestly can not rave enough about this place ... it be really a hidden gem worth check out !
my favorite cuban cafe in Orlando
I have be eat cuban for a long time , sandwich mainly along with other dish ..
the place be chill and comfortable .
they do not speak the best English but enough to get by .
they bake bread fresh daily , they do not press they sandwich which be the way I like it , and the meat be always fresh .
they have a great lunch special with you choice of meat , chicken , steak , or pork and rice and black bean and fry plantain .
and they breakfast be awesome !!
stop in and have a bite you will not regret it .
a slice of heaven in winter park off forsyth !
I have be go to Warner Family for a number of year and would highly recommend it to anyone .
I have read some of the review below and would like to state that yes , like any other doctor 's office there be sometimes a wait ( depend on what other patient be be see for ) and some of the test and procedure that be run can be costly ( just like they would be for any other medical test elsewhere if you do not have insurance ) ...
I have see several of the provider from the office and have not once be show anything but care and consideration .
I can not speak for they but any test or appointment they recommend be probably in the best interest of we ( the patient ) and you have the ability to decline anything that they suggest to you .
I personally have have wonderful service and if you be truely look for a family practice ... Warner Family be the place for you .
we read the good reviews before go and have high hope .. but to we dismay it do not turn out that way !
very frustrating for a restaurant that have 1 rosette and be supposedly renowned for the service ... hmm there be no canape' or amuse to keep we occupied , once we complain about the wait they take we something to nibble on but that take we get out we chair and wonder round to do that and it be impossible to get anyone 's attention .
scallop be overcooked and the foie gras be cold but the rest of the food be lovely .
on top of that though they try to charge we service charge just to rub it in ....
would not go back as there be a lot of place a lot better and cheaper .
nice selection , very clean , friendly staff !
Hot Iron have become a favorite of we family .
everyone can get the signature dish with ingredient and spice that they want and have the fun of watch it cook .
the staff be very friendly and conscientious .
they always ask if you have meat in you dish , ( for vegetarian like I ) , they scrub a area of the grill and use separate utensil to cook .
they do not just dump you ingredient on and cook either , but carefully separate meat to the hotter part of the grill and still manage to keep the veggy from turn to mush .
the selection of meat , veggy and sauce be awesome too !
every time we go they seem to have a different ingredient or two which keep thing interesting .
meat be keep very cold , seafood smell fresh and the serving bar be very clean .
price be reasonable , ( kid 's meal be around 4.99 ) and Wednesday's they have discount dinner price , I believe .
great cookie , cake , and customer service
it be my birthday and I have a last minute idea to have a bakery cake instead of one pre-make in a convenience store , but the problem be it be the day before Valentine 's and when many bakery turn I down for a plain vanilla rectangle cake , Fiona step up to the plate and be able to make a fantastic beautiful cake .
not only do it taste wonderful , but the texture be unbelievable , the frosting be not overly sweet to over power the cake , and the cake itself be just amazingly soft , and fluffy , and just perfect overall .
although I will have to drive a little out of my way to go there , I will gladly do it know that since she be be astounding to I once before that she will always be that way !
( also she have a really great website !
and we buy a few cookie there too , they be fantastic as well ! )
she deserve many 5 star review !!
food craving gone and weight loss at acupuncture doctor
I be a college student .
before treatment , my food craving be " out of control " which cause I to be stress out .
I experience a definite decrease in food craving ( about 50 % ) and decrease in stress after the 1st treatment .
I be amazed .
I be now more at peace and my food craving be about 99 % gone after only 3 treatment .
before come to acupuncture doctor I be a big baby about needle and only come because my boyfriend 's aunt recommend it .
what I like most about Dr. Liau be that she be very caring .
she talk to you at each appointment .
I can tell she really care and want to help .
I be so glad to have find Dr. Liau .
now I feel more confident wear my bathing suit in the summer .
a asset to Richmond
for a long time , one big source of entertainment missing from the Richmond city limit be a first - run multiplex .
Bowtie have fill that role nicely .
the theatre be in a old brick warehouse , which be a block away from the Flying Squirrels stadium .
the owner of Bowtie mang to add something new while preserve what be already there .
the theatre have greatly improve the surround neighborhood .
there be plenty of parking , and I have never have a issue with audience member who will not stop talk or answer they cellphone .
best of all , there be no ad !!!! !
just preview and the main feature .
expect to pay full price , and the theatre themselves be on the small side .
but if you like go to the movie , you should love Bowtie .
the manger also play a classic movie on Sundays , you can get a beer in the lobby , and repeat customer can get discount if they have a member card .
a great cinema in a great location .
thank you , Bowtie !
craft wonderland with history
my first visit be so fun yesterday .
I could have stay all day and not see all the thing .
I be do origami jewelry and find exactly the right thing for earring and get many other idea there too .
I buy a beginner 's quilling set and like make the filigree form you can make and add to other craft .
the owner , Jean , have be there 31 year !
what a history .
she be a super sweet , lovable and well - inform woman with a great sense of humor .
I really enjoy meet she and happy to learn she come from Oklahoma and have the value of a solid no bs country girl .
this store be a real gem and have much to offer the serious crafter or the occasional crafter .
by the way , Salmagundi ( the store name ) mean something like smorgasbord ; potpourri ; motley ; variety ; mix bag ; miscellaneous assortment ; mixture , a variety of many kind of thing .
great name for a great store !
shop local !

the 2010 Genesis be grrrrrrrreeeaaat !
I be a proud owner of a brand new 2010 Hyundai Genesis .
I have never see this car before until this lady at wal mart have it and she tell I she get it here and that everyone be so nice to she .
we get to talk and he get I set up and I test drive with Craig and I fall head over heel for this car all I keep say , " be I get to have it ! "
I thouhgt it would be out of my price range but they really work with I and now I could not be happier .
Jeff and Craig be really good at what they do and know exactly how to treat a customer .
definitely go see they !
bait and switch , untrained worker
call the Bonanza store 2 week ago , before I rip out 350 sq ft of ceramic tile ... be tell I would need a " dual head concrete grinder " to remove thinset and make a nice " finish " look ( ready for concrete stain ) .
be quote $ 55 all inclusive of grinder insert , etc .
no problem , sound like it be do every day .
will look beautiful .
get the tile rip out , call today , now all the sudden this grinder will not leave a finish look and it be $ 125 plus around $ 75 for the insert .
so from $ 55 to $ 260 ?
be they serious ?
I feel like they do not tell I the pitfall before I pull out this tile and now that I have no other option they want 5 time the price ?
either these people do not know anything about what they be rent , or worse - they be bait and switch .
one suspect that earlier reviewer work for another laundry .
outside of parking be at a premium , especially on discount day , the Laundry Tub be not filthy and it be no smaller than any of a dozen laundromat I have be in .
yes , there be bigger , but bigger be not necessarily better .
I avail myself of the wash and fold service , take just about a year 's worth of dirty clothes in and get back neatly fold , clean clothes in clear plastic bag ( I have originally bring they in , in six large yellow garbage bag ) .
the cost be certainly reasonable and I will continue my patronage of the Laundry Tub in the future .
do not hurt any that they know my name by my second visit and greet I warmly then and on my third visit .
whereas my answer to the question " where do you get you laundry do ? " use to be , " at the checkout line at WalMart , " I can honestly say the answer now be , " at the Laundry Tub . "
thank you !
I recently take a rescue puppy to this clinic and I be shocked at how well Romeo and my family be treat .
they work around the clock to ensure that my puppy life be save .
lol they where super friendly towards we and treat we like people not walk bag of cash .
in this day it be rare to find such wonderful people who care , not the kind of want to make cash .
I would strongly suggest you give they the chance to prove to you that not all people in this world be evil !
I live nearly two hour away and yet I will still make the drive to see they !
in fact I look forward to take my animal to the vet simply because of how my animal and I be treat .
okay , here be the scoop .
I be a regular at the HH .
the food be excellent , the serivce be horrible .
I think they be still in the mindset from when it be only smoker sit around and drink ... not in any hurry .
in my experience the food have be excellent ( for the most part ) .
in some case the result be because of understaffing , in some case the staff just do not care / know better .
they must also get something to keep take - out warm , so it be not room temperature at best when you get it home .
nice local pub , excellent food ( especially wing ) , and do not go if you have a limited amount of time .
trust the Midas touch
I personally trust this Midas store with all my vehicle , I have be go there for year & would never go anywhere else !
the staff be very personable & actually care about the customer safety rather than take there money .
this be however a very busy shop but there be appointment available & the staff up front will surely make sure you get back in a timely manner .
I look at some of these other comment & laugh because people think that the world revolve around they !
like the girl with the fuse problem ...
Midas have the most high tech equipment in town & I guarantee you if they tell you it be electrical then in deed it be electrical !
maybe you should understand how the world work & realize you be just like any other person & not put yourself on a pedestal .
I will continue go to Dave at Midas because he be one of the most honest business owner in this town !
when have you car work on you have to trust the mechanic & this Midas be truly someone you can trust !
we decide to try this place last night because we notice that it have some interesting thing on the menu aside from the usual roll -- live scallop sashimi , duck breast nigiri with foie gras , panko mussel -- but none of these be particularly great or worth the sticker price .
additionally we try the Logan Circle roll , spicy crab and tuna roll , and sweet potato tempura roll ( $ 15 , $ 10 , and $ 3.75 respectively ) .
the other roll be not at all special , especially give they pricing .
the bottom line be that the food be not great and be relatively high - priced .
the service be solicitous , the atmosphere be nice and mod except the out - of - place flat - screen tv play football .
but I would go elsewhere unless the price be cut .
it be just not worth it .
do not expect sleep or courtesy
I be book for 2 night at this hotel in Oct 2007 .
at 3:15 am on night # 2 , the fire alarm and strobe light activate in my room .
these be not household type alarm .
when they sound off , it be a true audio / visual experience .
I call the front desk and get no answer .
after check for sign of fire or smoke and see none , I decide to just pack up and leave .
the desk agent actually argue with I , claim that no such alarm have go off ( as if I would make that up ? ) .
he finally admit that only the 4 ada room alarm have sound , so only 4 guest be effect ( no big deal to he ) .
this little drip offer no apology whatsoever , and even refuse to give I the name of the manager until I press he for it 3 time .
this hotel be adequate enough , but there be a obvious problem with the staff and management .
do not go there if you expect to sleep through the night .
poor service , lack of passion : do not go
I begin see Dr. Romanick back in 2000 and have see a significant decline in the quality of care , patient - doctor communication , and just the overall level of service .
the poor quality start at the receptionist desk , where the staff be very impatient and lack the efficiency I once love about the office .
also , I be promise to have my test result email to I , but it never happen , and after a few attempt to get Dr. Romanick on the phone to brief I on my condition , I finally give up and go to a different doctor .
please do not go there if it be professional , friendly , diligent medical service you be look for .
save yourself the trouble , money and time and visit a more caring facility / doctor .
the moving company be actualy base in Brooklyn , but advertise all over NY / NJ , include Fort Lee .
when the guy arrive ( 2 hour later than agree ) they tell that you have to pay all the toll they pay come from Brooklyn and extra $ 100 for they to drive back from you destination .
that be not in agreement eather , but they realy demand it .
and another $ 100 for wrap the furniture .
so total $ 212 just for start before any work start .
guess what , be not in the initial agreement as well .
I be move out from 2 bdr apartment and it take for 3 strong guy 6 hour to load a track ( from 2 pm - 8 pm ) .
one more thing , they do not take any credit card or check .
you have to pay cash only before they start unload track on you destination .
worst apartment ever
we live here for 2 year , the first year or so be okay .
then , the more power they give to Linda , the worse the place get .
we be always have we water shut off , there be always people have party at the pool , even after it be suppose to be close .
Linda be the rudest person you will ever talk to and she stick up for all of the trashy , rude people that live there , not the nice one that actually give a crap about respect other .
do not live here , you will regret it !
the worst experience ever !!!
I have work with Ted Jurek at Decor and You , and it start out as a decent experience .
he be refer to I by a friend , who do not have the best experience with Ted , but say that Ted be able to make up for he lack of preparedness at the end .
I figure I would give this company a chance .
however , after give a require $ 500.00 ( non refundable ) deposit before see any plan or idea , I be sorry I do .
we meet a couple of week later , Ted be late .
he bring fabric book , and picture of furniture only , which all come way over budget .
by the time we get to the budget i tell he I could work with , there be basically no design .
just curtain and a couple of accessory .
what be that ?????
this company be way too expensive with nothing to show for it .
please everyone .... take heed and do not get catch up in the hype about DECOR and YOU work with every budget ...
this be just a way for they to squirm they way into you precious pocket
when we walk in , the person behind desk say : " oh well , you must wait , I be in the middle of something . "
after a good few minute , he ask : " what do you want ? "
somewhere in between he rudeness he ask if we smoke .
I ask if this hotel have smoking room .
he immediately say " no , there be a $ 50 deposit now ! "
sure enough he charge it to the credit card .
when I inquire he rudely reply " in the morning when thing be check out you will get it back . "
I call customer service about it because the website specifically state that there be no other charge at the check - in .
I also mention to the reception person .
he respond " we have problem with ' people ' " .
imagine a hotel have problem with people .
I finally alert he to he rudeness .
he say he be have a long and bad day .
we have no choice but to stay but will take this as far as we can .
do not stay there .
I come to find out the person be the hotel owner also .
we live within 20 mile of the hotel and want to get away from we responsibility for the night .
unfortunalty my husband and I have to put we 13 year old lab down that morning and we be not expect this .
my friend call the hotel to cancel we room as soon as I call she .
they say that we be to be charge for this room regardless because we do not cancel within the 72 hour .
I call they back a few hour after put my Bodhi down and they still would not budge .
time be hard , I know , but they have no compassion .
I call 3 time to talk to a manager , never a call back .
I email 4 time , never a response .
in one of the email I attach the letter from the vet 's that express they sympathy , this hotel do nothing .
I even email Mackinaw Tourist and nothing .
I be sure this be a good place to stay from read the other review , but if something unexpected happen in you life , they will not care .
ok I be a New Yorker who have be go to school in Oxford , England .
I think the UK be completely devoid of good NYC style pizza .
I think to get a decent pizza the only way be at a fancy restaurant , and I have to get a whole pie .
I think I would have to wait until I go home to NYC .
well then I go on a trip to Glasgow and be walk around .
I see this place and it look like the holy grail .
they have crush red pepper flake and oregano .
so I order a slice .
it taste like I just fly back home .
I do not know how they do it , but scottish friend --- this be the real deal .
I congratulate this establishment for do the research on make NYC pizza because these Scots fcking nail it .
that be say , I do not know how they delivery service be .
they might want to change the name to reflect the new yorkedness of the pizza , scrummy yummy sound gimmicky to I .
good food , good wait staff , poor management
we visit on 7/26/08 for dinner we receive a gift certificate for the Mama Mia 's on Greenfield Ave .
the food be good , and so be we waitress .
when it come time to pay the bill up front , they would not let I use any of the certificate for a tip ( which I have do with any other restaurant I have get a gift certificate for . )
I then ask if I could have money back in cash .
the person go to go check with the manager , who be sit at a table chat with she friend who be eat there .
she answer be short and manner rather rude .
sorry for interrupt I guess .
the cashier be also short , unapologetic and make I feel as I be waste she time .
there be no other option available ( I only bring my check card to cover any overage cost ) and she ring it up and apply it to the gift card before tell I about the tip policy .
I will not be visit Mama Mia 's again .
there be other place with food just as good with management that value customer and employee much more .
dine at TEXAS ROADHOUSE
TEXAS ROADHOUSE have very good meal , that the meat come right off the bone .
it have very good price .
on a bad note the waiting area be not enjoyable or enough seat .
also , there should not be peanut all over the floor .
it be not a big deal but I have to take my salad home because they forget to bring it .
I have to ask the girl who bring my food and she never come back to let I know .
I have to wait for my waitress .
when you first come in the hostess be not very friendly , there be just a bunch of worker stand there .
I be there on MARCH 6th , 2009 .
I be also there on JULY 4th 2008 , when my daughter 's BUFFALO wing come out with a fly on it .
the manager come over and say he be sorry and give a new batch of wing , he say we can not really do anything because the door be always open and close .
in my opinion should have just take off the price of the wing from the bill .
but everyone have there own way !!!!!!
mezza luna ftw !
they mezza luna' be deffly better than the pizza roll .
it be like a pizza roll , but they just toss ham and cheese inside .
it seem like it be healthier too , but it be prolly not .
also , you can call em ahead of time , and then go to pick up ur food , or have it deliver ** .
that cut down on the wait time , cause u can do other stuff while u be wait .
it usually take 20 min for a mezza luna , as they have to add pure delicious extract to the mix .
they pizza be a little salty for I , but it be still good .
they do that whole thing where you sandwich the pepperoni between layer of cheese for + 32 delicious .
it run you about 4 buck and it deal crush blow to hunger .
** edit : live on campus at Clarkson University , I have have food deliver before .
this be back between '05 and '09 and I do not remember how many time we have have it deliver .
perhaps they do not deliver anymore , but the deliciousness of a mezza luna certainly warrant a pickup .
my 2004 x - type be get close to 100,000 mile so it be time for a upgrade .
I send my wife and daughter over to check out a pre-owned 2009 XF .
Michael Chestney be very pleasant and patient with my wife and she suggest I go check it out .
I go in later that afternoon and meet with Michael .
he show I the car I be interested in and we take a test drive .
I love the car so we begin negotiate my trade - in and the price of the 09 XF .
the entire negotiation take about 20 minute .
fair give and take on both side until we agree on a deal that be within my parameter and be fair to both side .
10 minute of paperwork and I be the owner of a beautiful pre-owned 09 XF .
friendly , knowledgeable , and above all fair .
that be all you can really ask from a car dealer and Michael and Barrett hit all 3 .
thanks for the great deal and the great car !
myself and my fiance 's identity be steal from the office staff .
we be tell by a detective and ask to check we credit for anything unusual .
luckily they catch the crook before they do one on we .
it be a black female that use to work in the office .
she steal the information and give it to another guy that do all the work .
the other guy be pull over one day and a cop see suspicious papers with name and social security number on it .
that be how they be catch .
they both go to jail and a new manager be put in charge of the apartment .
the apartment across from mine belong to a gang of hooker .
nobody live there .
a girl would show up , then a guy in a nice car would show up .
my apartment be usually quiet .
I live in one that do not face the parking lot .
parking space be just big enough for a Mini Cooper .
it suck have a suv .
if I find a spot , I could not fit in it .
bug be a small problem , nothing too bad .
the best there be in service .
I be recently travel down I - 24 from Nashville with my 3 young child and have a blowout on the southeast side of Murfreesboro .
it be 4:50 when a friend tell I to call Bud , he would take care of I .
not only do they answer the phone at 4:50 on a Thursday , they hit the ground move !.
they track down the only tire that fit my BMW 330i in Murfreesboro within minute and secure it , then they come out , take off my tire ( it be a runflat - but runflat do not do you any good if they blow out ) , and bring it to they shop to change the tire .
they be back quickly consider how far outside of Murfreesboro we be and have we on we way by 6:30 that evening .
thanks Bud for all of you help and take time away from you family that evening .
it be without a doubt , the best service experience I have ever have and just to be clear , the price he charge I be the same as my tire guy in Nashville 's price for put on the other rear tire .
I hope I can return the favor in the future !
room ok .
I have stay in this hotel many time , and while it typically offer a decent bang for the buck , its client base largely consist of troubled youngsteer and evictee from the local , not so pleasant hood .
I have never consider this a real problem as I travel without kid and can fend for myself , but when I have to listen to a ( non-violent ) domestic fight that last from 1 am to 5 am during my last stay and I find out that the front desk be unmanned during night hour , my choice be to either waste tax payer money by call for a yet another police dispatch to this hotel , or just get over it .
I choose the later , but approach the front desk about the hotel policy to push over they responsibility on local authority , not to mention the good night 's sleep i pay for but do not get .
I be tell management would call I back but still wait for that call .
I will probably stay here again because it be cheap and I can not afford a better hotel , but do not look forward to it and would definitely not recommend this hotel for family or single female traveller .
be there this past weekend and the guy behind the counter yell at I and my son because we believe he leave the grandma slice in the oven a little too long and the cheese get all dry out and the slice taste more like a cracker .
he proceed to grab the slice off the countertop and throw it into the trash while yell at I say , " you do not order what you do not know about " and " you do not know how pizza be make " .
it be very upsetting to see this kind of behavior especially in front of my four year old .
he be in the process of make I a pie and when I get home , the pie be the worst I have ever see .
cheese be fall off , so oily and greasy .
I think he do it on purpose because of my simple request for another slice of grandma that be not so well - done ( actually , burnt ) .
I will never go back to this place and I be report they to the better business bureau for such horrible customer relation and basically sabotage my pizza and take my $ 25 .
this story be 100 % true .
that little man who think he invent pizza can kiss my *ss .
long line , silly rule , rude staff , ok food
the first thing you notice when you arrive on location be that the waiting line literally go out the door and spill into the parking lot .
a restaurant with this many patron willing to stand in line just to order taco must be good , right ?
I mean , that be the way it work at amusement park : the longest line be at the best ride .
well , this may be a exception .
the staff take you order and " wait " on you be very indifferent and have no sense of costumer service at all .
and do not even think about ask to speak to the manager because this guy be , and pardon my French , a jerk .
save yourself the trouble and skip this place all together .
I suggest you go up to rage Taco & rage Burrito a couple of block up the street or even Taco Mac .
wish this be in Saratoga --
we be introduce to Bistro Tallulah by traveler - professional diner who happen to own the Adelphi Hotel and travel the world -- and reside in Paris , London , New York the rest of the year .
she know great food and dining experience .
she be dead on -- this restaurant be wonderful --- do not be put off by the one negative review on this page .
I can tell you we be pleasantly surprise -- BT have taste memory and each time back the food be consistently delicious -- same dish -- be consistent .
we friend be a world traveler and love unpretentious dining experience and inspired food .
this chef know what he be do .
treat yourself and go -- you will go back !
I be a business owner in downtown Saratoga Springs and wish this restaurant be in we town !
the affordable rent make it possible for a inspired chef to serve he high quality fare at affordable price !
unlike Saratoga .
I rrly seek the cehf out to introduce myself -- but the second time we go -- i make a point of ask we wait person to introduce my friend and myself to the chef to tell he just how good we meal be .
can not wait to go gain .
- R. Morris .
I think that the be pretty good .
first of all , if you call for a appointment they will not tell you to call back a month later so you can then make one .
they also do not tell you that they be go to mail you a " application " to be admit to be a patient .
I feel that the way some doctor 's office work around here be a little bit absurd so I be happy that these guy do not do those two thing in particular .
usually you can be see the same week or maybe the follow week .
the doctor do tell I that my male pattern baldness be due to my mother 's father because the gene be exclusively pass on through maternal line but that be a common misconception ( http://www.consumerreports.org/health/healthy-living/beauty-personal-care/hair-loss-10-08/hair-loss.htm ) .
in general I would say that the staff be attentive and nice .
but then again I be nice to they so that could have be why .
anyhow , after read some of the other review it seem like some of the other reviewer be expect mircle .
if you want miracle you will have to go to 21st St .
it be a pretty typical primary care office but for the area it be very good .
they do not do certain thing that be really annoying about other office .
first trip to Canada
I recently travel to Canada on business and have a most excellent experience .
I work for a large retail company recently expand we operation into Canada and have to travel to ensure all of we computer network equipment be install properly and on time .
this can tend to be a stressful experience in itself let alone add cross boarder for the first time .
I be very pleased to find my accommodation and the hotel staff to be a very calming and comforting part of my trip .
I find the hotel to be amazingly clean , not to mention very well adorn with many pleasant surprise .
from my first encounter at check in to my regrettable check out I find the staff and facility to exceed my expectation .
I completely enjoy my whole check in experience and be impressed with the friendliness and professionalism of the staff as well as the accommodation themselves .
I will be travel in this area in the future and you can be assure that this experience will be helpful in my choice of hotel and Novotel will be my first selection .
yes the parking can be a challenge but be from NJ I be no stranger to tight corner .
please pass my appreciation to the staff and management for they excellent hospitality and good spirit as it help make a stressful trip enjoyable .
favorite place in Tampa .
update : I have to add to my review .
I be just in last night and have a chance to dine in they new dining room .
I frequent this resturant on a weekly basis but usally only for lunch .
well I be in for a treat when I be greet by the friendly girl at the counter who ask if my wife and I would like to sit in they " new " dining room .
right away they tell we that it be the same great food with the same price so off we go .
we be greet again and sit promptly .
after look at the menu and see the new menu item they have , we know we be in for a treat !
I have the chicken parmesan dinner and my wife have the shrimp scampi dinner .
the portion be generous enough that we even take some home !
I have to say the value of this place always amaze I .
it be nice to see that even in the economy we can eat a place that have upscale service , amazing atmosphere , and incredible food , but not break the bank while enjoy it !
bottom line be that when it be a small privatly own resturant like this be you can tell that the owner and employee take pride in they product and service .
well do !
great work and honest establishment !
I typically have work do on my Jeep at the dealership , but it be 6 year old now and get charge dealership price just do not seem cost effective anymore .
I have try out few place around the area and have be rip off a few time .
I have hear great thing about Phet and G&G Automotive so I decide to give he a try .
the service be excellent and personable .
he check out what I need to have do tell I what need be fix before he do any work and do great repair work .
the price be actually lower than what I have anticipate and use to compare to other place , plus he show I the work he do when I come in to pick up the car .
also , a week after the work , Phet call I up to see how my car be run and to let I know that they have accidentally overcharge I for part of the work and want to give I a refund for that amount .
that be just unheard of these day !
I grow up in a small town where you know and trust you mechanic and be really cynical about city auto repair shop since I move here , but Phet have show that there really be honest hard work mechanic around .
he be my mechanic go forward !
we company be a high end designer handbag and fashion accessory company , thus we be certainly a niche market .
we have be evaluate seo provider for quite some time and finally decide to take the plunge with Stuart , and Ulistic .
we make the decision for a couple of reason .
1 . social media .
we be familiar with search engine optimization strategy , but new nothing about social media - we just hear that it be the next big thing .
2 . we really like the fact that Stuart set define objective and we meet once a month to go over we key performance indicator .
how have it go so far ?
we be absolutely confident that Stuart 's ethical and focus strategy will see these trend continue to grow , and we business will reap the reward of this program .
finally , it must be say that Stuart be a fantastic person to work with , because of he solid strategy and equally as importantly because he be a genuinely good person and a great communicator .
excellent service and quality
I have Hom - Excel replace most of the window in my Tampa residence three year ago .
the excellent window have perform without any problem , but that be not why I be write my review .
three week ago , burglar try to gain entry into the rear of my home .
the intruder slit the screen of the window .
next , they try to force the window with a pry bar and then to break the window with a hammer .
the window do not break !
my next - door neighbor hear the noise and turn on a light , thankfully scare the two miscreant away ( they even leave they hammer behind ! ) .
I call Home - Excel the next day to order a replacement screen for the window , and be happily surprise when they say that they be not even go to charge I for the replacement screen ... that it would be cover under they guarentee .
lo and behold , they replace the screen ( which have to be order ) yesterday and do not charge I a dime .
they worker even clean 3 of my window and change a lightbulb for I .
in this day and age , it be so rare to find a company with such nice worker and such far range guarantee policy .
I rarely write review such as this one , but they certainly deserve anyone 's business !
friendly staff , but definitely some problem
May , 2009 .
we be book at the Sheraton with a number of other out - of - town wedding guest .
get put into the wrong room the first night , and be quite surprised to have someone with the same room key try to get in the door at 1:00 am !
next day get move into another room , on the same floor with other wedding guest .
there be 3 adult in we room but towel for only 2 , no linen for sofa bed .
in the second room it take 3 try to get all the towel and linen we request .
a package and some wedding card be leave in we first room .
security in the hotel seem to be excellent , but we be never give a explanation as to why someone would open these item .
a mid-afternoon " fire drill " be disruptive , put everyone out of the hotel .
when we call the front desk about a extremely boisterous crowd in the hall outside we door quite late at night , it seem to take the hotel staff quite a while to quiet they down .
be careful of who you sale guy be
I think this place be probably really great especially judge by the reviews on here .
my experience be awful though .
it all have to do with the sales guy which be a young 22 year old who have admittedly only be work for 2 week .
I be extremely interested in the car and very likely would have buy it , but the sales guy I deal with ruin the deal .
I do not know if the kid have a bad day or what , but I have to sit and apologize about nothing for 10 minute until he drop the issue .
after that , I just try to ignore he lack of professionalism and test drive the car .
I play dumb and ask he question that I already know the answer to and he respond with half truth and a few falsehood .
for instance I ask who own Mazda and he say with confidence that be GM , which be not true .
I mean , I do not care if he do not know , but if he pretend to know and tell I bs to my face , there be no way I be go to trust he when matter turn to the price of the car and financing .
the worst chinese I have ever have
this be by far the worst chinese food I have ever have .
the service stink .
I call in my order and upon arrive to pick it up , they get my order confuse with someone else 's .
they help about three other people before they offer to help I again .
they also get my friend 's order mix up and want to charger she $ 10 more than what she have want .
she ask for the dinner combo and they give she two dinner plate instead .
we be stand in the store for 20 minute to simply pick up a order .
not to mention that the wait staff be about as pleasant as deal with a angry bull .
they be abrasive and rude - when they be the one who mess everything up .
we have to throw out about 80 percent of we meal because the food taste so horrible .
I do not know how it be possible to make orange chicken , sesame chicken and kung pao chicken as well as cheese puff taste that bad but China Delight accomplish that .
the only thing that be edible be the steam rice and the vegetable lo mein be barely tolerable .
I will never go here again .
Lucky Panda in Willis be a billion time better in service and quality of the meal .
I have no idea how China Delight win number 1 chinese restaurant in Montgomery - there need to be a recount on that vote .
one of the worst experience I have ever have with a auto repair shop .
we take we vehicle in for a repair to the air conditioning .
approx 4 month later , the compressor go out .
we take it back in to have it repair again , and less than a week later the second compressor go out .
we go in for a third visit and they fix it again , but this time when we pick up the car , the radio and clock do not work .
so for the 4th time in 5 month and the third time in 2 week , we bring the car back again .
when we express we discontent to the manager ( that be right , the manager ) , do he say he would return some money , do he say he would give a discount on we next visit , do he just say " I be sorry " .
nope , none of the above .
he stand there and tell we how he be not at fault .
it be the fault of the part supplier , and can we imagine how he feel have to put another 2 hour of work in the car .
at no time during the conversation do the word , " I be sorry " ever come out of he mouth .
I , nor anyone else in my family , will ever go to Sun Devil Auto again .
well , unless of course the third compressor he put in the car go out .
do not use this company !
I drop off a sheet metal piece that I need copy due to th it be need to be replace .
I ask if they could copy the piece I drop off .
they say it would be make exactly like the one I need to replace .
I pick it up when it be finished and be charge 30.00 .
when I get to the job and try to insert the new piece of metal it would not fit !!
I take the original piece of metal and rig it to make due since I have to complete the job .
I take the receipt and the metal that do not fit and ask Pomper for my money back .
the girl at the desk be sooo rude I could not believe it !
she tell I she could not use the piece I be return and the company would only put it in the trash so I could not return it .
I explain I do not get what I pay for .
she ask I to bring the original piece back and I tell she I have to use it on the job .
she tell I that be too bad she would do nothing to help I since she could not use or resell the piece .
I say I be go to trash it also and could I at least have a credit .
with a smirk on she face she tell I no money be be return and that be the way it be .
do not use this company .
there be too many people that need we business to have to put up with this unfair treatment !!!!!
I would never recommend this gym to anyone and unfortunately this be base solely on the owner 's own unprofessionalism .
when I originally join in January I only do so because I be tell I would be able to cancel the 12 month membership if I be to move away .
I sign up with one of the staff who be very pleasant and professional .
actually work out there be good - the machine be nice and the class be fun .
the locker room be certainly lack - I would never shower or change there .
they need to update the locker room asap .
back to my poor rating - I be accept to medical school and go in to cancel my membership as I be tell I could do since I be move away .
the owner be very rude , accuse I of not read my contract , and basically tell I to shut up when I be try to ask question to further understand the process of cancel my membership .
I be able to cancel it but only after pay a $ 50 fee ( which the staff person who sign I up state I would not have to pay if I have proof of moving ) and be speak to in a very belittling manner .
I would understand if I be be treat this way by a staff member but the club 's actual owner ?!
bad for business .
I be appalled .
I will never recommend this gym to any woman .
there be better place on the cape - FITNESS 500 !
the salon experience from Hell
I feel obligated to share this story .
right out of college I call the salon and explain my situation .
just graduate , just move , not rich , and start new job soon .
I never get a price quote over the phone and they take you cc info just to make the appointment because if you do not show up , they will charge you .
I have this ridiculous celebrity stylist from LA name Derrick .
after he already put product on my hair he say " I should warn you , I be expensive . "
I want to be very blonde and instead he pull my root color throughout my whole hair which be a gross mousey brown .
the other stylist around I keep pressure I say he be so wonderful , you be go to love you hair .
$ 400 later my jaw drop when the receptionist tell I the total .
Derrick do a terrible job , be a complete jerk the entire time , and I have no warning as to the price .
I cry the entire way home .
he then " fix " it for free but it still look like crap .
I will never go back .
it be the salon experience from absolutely Hell .
he also tell I that he work on the cast of will and grace and that they be all jerk .
that be my favorite show of all time .
I be pretty sure for the cast that it be the other way around .
maybe he do not do a good job and they tell he so .
absolute nightmare !
stay away !
very unhappy ...
work with Rod Jacobsen be my first experience work with a cpa , so I do not know what to expect .
that say - he seem to be do well enough .
however , then I ask to amend my return to apply a credit I have just become eligible for .
I expect to pay for this service , but imagine my surprise when I receive a bill for more than what I pay to have the original return prepare .
ask why , Rod simply tell I that he have to research how to do the amendment ( it be a amended to show that I have purchase a home - nothing out of the ordinary , one would think ) and that take time to figure out .
well , that be strike one .
I be not go to use they again , but I be go to leave it at that .
last year , after all be say and do , I ask Rod whether my payment structure would leave I with no / little tax liability at the end of the year .
he say yes .
I may not have to pay a penalty , yet , but this be not what I have in mind when hire these guy .
in the word of my new accountant , they let I down !
bit sketchy , sporadic delivery time
I buy about half of the furniture I own from this place .
because they cut I good deal if I pay in cash .
sketchy , right ?
well they come through and deliver almost all of my item within a few day .
( they even get I a couch pretty quickly . )
the guy who be cut I the deal and get I the furniture quickly , Ahmed , be nice and mostly professional , except the semi-sketchiness .
then one day , Ahmed leave the country , not to return for month , without inform I .
he also neglect to tell the other person work at the store about a dining room table that I have order and that be suppose to be come in .
the other person work at the store do not know that I still have this table come .
I come back with the receipt Ahmed have provide upon my purchase , and the guy take forever to copy it but say that he would take care of the situation .
I wait .
and wait .
he never once contact we .
I have have to pester this new guy several time to ask when my table will arrive .
he keep say different arrival / delivery date and do not seem terribly apologetic .
point be : you might be able to get a good deal on some nice furniture -- which I do -- but they be not very communicative and god forbid something go wrong , you will have to fight to get it resolve .
run do not walk .
my experience with Home Delivery Service have be one of disappointment and anger .
if I could give they a lower rating than poor I would .
on August 21st , 2009 I order furniture from Hickory Furniture Mart and contract for HDS to deliver it .
after seventeen day the delivery van show up at my home minus two piece .
I be later tell they have be leave at the warehouse and some future date they would be deliver .
no one will give I a date .
I spend $ 2300 on the bedroom suite , which be complete and excellent condition on the showroom floor .
upon delivery it be clear the entire set be damage : a piece of wood be broke on the headboard ; the chest of drawer be miss all four piece necessary to attach the leg ; the dresser back leg be push in cause the dresser to lean into the wall ; and a nighstand be miss a drawer .
how do you lose a drawer .
after complain on September 10th to National Home Furnishings , Boyles , the Hickory Furniture Mart and Home Delivery Service the latter finally call I back and say they would be up to pick the dresser and chest of drawer at some future point and at some later point it would be professional repair and at some later point it would be return .
the customer service at Home Delivery Service be terrible let alone they promise to proper set up furniture .
so I be in limbo regard a bedroom suite .
I hope the owner and employee of this store have break bedroom suite in they home and furniture sit in someone 's warehouse .
maybe then they will begin to understand poor customer service and terrible sit up service .
excellent driving school
I be involve in a car accident 20 year ago and since then I have be a nervous wreck and have not be behind the wheel .
unfortunately , a family emergency require I to conquer this fear .
a very good friend of mine highly recommend the Professional Driving School and I be tell to specifically ask for Gerry .
I call the school most probably 10 time before I finally enrol in a 20 hour package .
I have to cancel my initial lesson 4 time and on the 5th attempt the management be quick enough to associate my cancellation with my fear and finally encourage I into take my initial lesson .
my heart pound as I walk down and pound even faster upon see Gerry in a SUV - Lexus !
I think of cancel the lesson once again because I do not feel comfortable drive a suv .
Gerry pleasantly say " since I be already here why do not we give it shot .
I trust you and believe that you will be able to handle this and all you have to do be to reciprocate !
trust I and most especially trust and believe in yourself .
do not worry , I will take care of you ! "
....... the rest be history !
here I be now drive confidently on my own .
Gerry , I can not thank you enough for help I cope with my fear .
review on house of Joy Chinese Restaurant
my family and I move to San Antonio a year ago and have try almost all of the chinese restaurant because we love chinese food .
well it take we a while to find one that we like .
but we do not just like house of Joy we love it .
everything we have get there have be more authentic and better taste than any other chinese restaurant in the San Antonio area we have be to -- and trust I we have be to a lot of they .
we just happen to stumble across this little restaurant one day when we have to visit the Bexar County Tax Office off of Bandera Road .
we stop in and get some take out and can not stop go back .
they have the best Egg Drop Soup I have ever taste .
we also love they egg roll and spring roll .
and every entree we have order be perfect .
everything be always cook fresh and taste fresh .
they price be extremely reasonable for the amount of food you receive .
the staff be also just so pleasant to deal with .
they be also quick at get you order out to you .
you do not have to sit and wait around forever like most place !!
so anyone look for a excellent night out for chinese or maybe just lunch should stop in and try it because I promise you 2 thing --- you will not regret it !!
and you will go back for more !!!

ps I have notice on here that someone leave a comment that " all of the nice comment must come from co worker or friend " and I will tell you that I do not know these people except from eat at they restaurant .
we be from Virginia and just move here a year ago .
so that comment be completely false .
because we think it be the best !!!
and we do not know they except for eat there .
Dr. Strzalka at Flagship CVTS be not a good doctor
I be not sure about the quality of the other doctor there , but i do know from personal experience that Dr. Christopher T. Strzalka be not a man of he word , and be also very cruel and uncaring !!
he be go to operate and replace my bicuspid aortic valve due to critical aortic stenosis .
I have a surgery date of July 17 , 2008 .
then he renigg when he read my Health Care Proxy , even though i agree to be on the ventilator for 2 month follow surgery ( as he have twice state i must agree to ) .
he later say that by 2 month he " mean at least two month " .
two month and at least two month be totally different thing .
he do not even give I the chance to say i would stay on the ventilator longer , which i would have .
a Health Care Proxy be not write in stone and can be change .
he also never even say he be sorry .
just say i be inoperable and walk out of the hospital room .
so , therefore , now he say i be inoperable ( even though i be not 100 % inoperable ) , and he be let I die .
I be just middle aged and do not want to die , but thanks to this doctor i have no other alternative .
I , along with my friend , consider this doctor to be the cause of my death as he be not even try to save my life by operate .
he say it sarcastically .
what you can learn from the below ' bad experience ' .
I would suggest not avoid Second Home base on the ' bad experience ' review .
I would probably be more inclined to board my two dog here , see that they do not just take every dog come in .
I have tour this place and be impress by how clean the place be , and all the option for the dog .
it be unfortunate that bmil believe that he ' perfect ' dog be not give the right opportunity to prove himself .
worker who do these introduction look at the interaction objectively ; and it be good to see they be able and willing to say no if they feel there would be a problem .
it sound ( accord to you own statement ) that they have a roomful of dog , so they must be do something right - and be keep those dog safe from potential problem .
you say you work a lot , and that you have a young dog ; so I have little doubt that you dog be just fill with energy to burn ; and it be good of you to look for a place to take he .
but not at a risk to other people 's pet .
no business be go to push customer away without good reason ; so be not it reasonable to think they might know what they be do ?
my dog be far from perfect , and one of they I believe would be a little much for daycare here herself ( at least initially ) .
be a little more reasonable with you expectation of a place like this ; and maybe do not jump to personal attack suggest that they do not want to work hard , just because you bruise you own ego .
dumbest f'er ever
I call dominos tonight , it ring forever , I get put on hold twice without say a word and finally someone say , may I help you ?
so I say : I be at the Radison Warwick hotel in Rittenhouse Square ( build in 1926 ) do you deliver to the Warwick ?
they say no , Warwick in New Jersey , call New Jersey .
I laugh and say , no , that Warwick be in New York , but I be at the Radison - Warwick .
and he say : you be at Warwick in Pennsylvania ?
I say , no , I be at the RADISON WARWICK HOTEL in Rittenhouse Square .
he say : I not know that town , I have to get to work , I be in PHILLY .
call dominos in you town .
I say listen : I be at 17th and LOCUST , do you deliver there ?
he say , I have to have a exact address .
ok , 1701 LOCUST STREET i say .
he say : why you tell I you be in WARWICK TOWNSHIP ?
he give the phone to a girl , she say , I have to have you address , I say , do you deliver to 17th and locust , she say , you exact address , I say 1 - 7 - 0 - 1 Locust , be you sure ? she ask ?
yes I be sure , well , she say , be that on 17th street .
yes , I say .
17th , like over by 16th and 15th yes , I say , one mile west of you .
you be at 7th .
I be just south of Walnut .
she say , be that 17th like over past broad .
yes , I be west of broad .
Broad , I say , be 14th street and I be 3 block west of broad and one south of walnut .
hmmm , she say , then why be you call here , we do not go past broad ?
anyway , after much yelling and cussing I hang up , grab a cab , and go to Geno 's .
quick to take money but not quick to fix a problem !
B&B come out very quickly to give we we quote back in June .
they be very polite , eager to answer any question and willing to wait for we to return from vacation to begin install we fence .
we fence be install quickly in August and they have they money and leave say " workmanship be guarantee for a year ! " .
within a week we notice one of the board on we gate split where a nail have go in .
we call we representative who assure I he would call the office and have it take care of .
we hear nothing .
we then call the office and the man we speak to say he would send someone out to look at it but could not promise when - two week come and go and we hear nothing .
I just call again and be tell that workmanship , not wood , be guarantee for a year - well in my opinion - the wood split due to a nail which be part of workmanship !
she even go so far as to say " you be call about one board ? "
well - when you pay over $ 1000 for something you want it to hold up and look good !!!
I be call about one board !!
I be very frustrated at this point - it would take all of 10 min for they to come by and replace the one board that be crack ( the crack be deep enough to stick a penny in it and it go clear through ) yet they do not want to take the time to bother with what once be a happy customer and have now become a dissatisfied customer .
so I figure if they do not want to take the time to fix the fence that they install then I will take the time to let everyone I can know about how they treat customer once they have you money !!!
stay away !!!
you get what you pay for !!!
they come in under a lot of other quote and now I know why !!!
when the fence be first install I would have give they five star , now for they poor customer follow - up and unwillingness to fix the fence they have drop to a one - star in my opinion !
lot of rule , phantom innkeeper , last minute price be worth it .
I call the " 207 " number and listen to the same recording loop 3 time before I give up .
I then call the 800 number ( which be answer ) and inquire about last minute rate .
they have a room with a $ 99 rate , which I book .
the room be suppose to be on the 2nd floor , but they put we on the 3rd .
the email confirmation ( which I read in the car ) warn about large suitcase , declare that we be innkeeper , not longshoreman .
in other word , they do not help with suitcase , but they promise tote to help .
however upon we arrival no one there ( the inn be open ) .
so no tote .
finally a chambermaid stick she head around the corner from the top of the stair and tell we sternly that we could not be accommodate until 3 m , no exception .
then she be gone .
we return after 3 pm , find no one there , and a note from the innkeeper with direction to we room .
rule in the room : # 1 ) if you drink the soda from the fridge in you room you must prove it by leave the can in the trash .
if they think you have take a soda from you room home with you , they will charge you $ 1.50 per can .
they count the can in the trash to make sure .
# 2 ) if you take the shampoo product home , they will charge you $ 8 per item .
# 4 ) breakfast be 8 am to 10 am .
no earlier and no later .
if you go later , it be all clean up .
( by whom , I do not know .
I never see anyone there .
all these rule be post in the room . )
snack : uninspired bread , tea back , and individual coffee thing for a machine that do not exist .
I put the coffee thing in hot water and settle for a cup of weak coffee .
no wine glass .
room be clean , but have a weird , dated , sink / stove combo that do not work .
bath be clean except shower stall which have mildew problem .
no tub .
the inn tout a shower with dual shower head , but only one work .
do not get the room off the two kitchen .
they be right off the kitchen so you hear everything .
free parking .
quit with the overstatement !
the worst thing that can happen for any restaurant like Zahav be to have too many people write hyperbolic review make claim that " everyone " be go to " love " the food , decor and service .
the truth be , in my and my dining partner 's experience , this be a fine little restaurant with some unique food .
it be a entirely up and down experience , however .
now , the best of that unique food come at the very beginning of the meal .
the salatim salad be the smallest plate I have ever see place in front of I ( you would most likely think they be condiment if it be not explain to you ) .
though they be mostly excellent , you generally do not get enough forkful to know if you really love they .
that be say , the laffa and hummus be out of this world .
then again , for the three of we who dine together , two piece of flatbread leave we fight for more , and lick the hummus from we finger ( and yes , those two piece of flatbread do represent a three - person order ) .
dinner be also a up - and - down experience .
the vegetarian dish and lighter fare be almost always spot - on , while the lamb be often dry and / or overcooked .
the duck be a 65 % glob of chewy fat with no resemblance to the juicy , crispy delicacy it usually represent at other establishment .
I guess that tell you a lot .
oh , yes , the chocolate semifreddo be quite good .
service be average , but nothing special , and restaurant that be suppose to be excellent should do a better job of train they waitstaff to be communicative and friendly , not merely capable .
perhaps have we not go into this restaurant believe Zahav be go to be golden as its name suggest ( and as the many golden review seem to attest ) , we would have enjoy a decent little expensive experience .
ps ) when we call for a reservation , we be tell that 5:00 and 9:30 be they only opening .
when we arrive at 5 , and leave circa 7 , there be the same 4 or 5 empty table surround we .
do they think we be go to feel lucky to get any reservation at all , and therefore be more pleased with we dining experience ?
must read - do not waste you time in this store .
at my appointment the girl help I be unable to adequately lace up some of the dress .
they feel like they be go to fall off of I and it be very difficult to see what I would actually look like be I to purchase some of these dress .
I think it would be a good idea to see how a few that I like would look like on a model ( by look the dress up online ) .
so , as I be leave I ask for the designer / dress name or style number associate with my top pick .
they say they be " unable to tell I until they order my dress " .
hmmm ... a person can not call a company , if you have no idea its name ( since the designer be unknown ... supposedly ) , and order a gown without a dress name or style number .
do other bride fall for this ???
they either : a ) do not want to give it to I because they do not want I purchase the dress elsewhere or b ) be recreate the dress themselves ( ie steal other designer 's dress design and " fill the order " by they own seamstress ) .
I be no detective but ... uhh ... seriously ?!?
whatever type of operation they be run , I be not interested and if you be smart , you will not be either .
what a waste of time .
aside from that little * mystery * , one of the sale lady be quite comfortable tell I how wrong I be about how another dress that I love compare to one of she dress that I be try on .
my point : even if I be wrong , do not sit there and argue with the customer .
say something like , " huh .
I do not think so but you could be right . "
unless you want to take the " tell the customer how wrong she be and try and force she into a dress she be obviously not love " approach which will likely get you ... uh ... nowhere .
seriously : do not waste you time .
other shop around this city have much nicer and more transparent owner .
I feel very much like Wedding Gallery be be dishonest and I would not trust they to lace I up in another gown let alone trust they with the gown I will wear on the most important day of my life .
awful service !
after happily visit Sear's Automotives in the past , I be shocked at the horrible service receive at they Greensboro location .
I bring my car in on a Sunday to replace a shred tire .
I wait about 20 minute in the store part before anyone be able to assist I and be then tell to pull my car into the shop ( that be apparently what you be suppose to do , but the big sign point you that way be for some reason keep inside the garage , so you do not see they drving up , and they purposely block the front pull - up that all other Sear's use ) .
once inside , I have to stand around for at least 10 more minute before -- finally -- a technician get to I .
once I return to pick up my car , you can believe I spend quite a bit more time stand around wait .
I have want to split the total between a credit card and check card since I be be reimburse for the tire but be tell this be not possible .
once I actually get back in my car , it be dirty and have grease all over the steering wheel .
ok , one bad experience ... fine .
the follow Friday , I return with my car to go ahead and replace the other 3 tire , which be worn .
I would not have go back , but I could not find the particular tire they have use in stock anywhere else .
once again , I wait for quite a bit before be attend to .
I get the order complete , and then question the technician since it come out about $ 40 less than I expect .
he say it be the same tire , and verify this , after check both the actual tire on my car and my service papers from earlier in the week .
however , when he print out the service quote , I could see that it be not the correct tire , and be not even a appropriate tire for my car model .
so I point this out to he , at which point he say they only have one of the correct tire in stock .
ok -- fine .
so I get just my other rear tire replace .
they promise it would be do within a hour , so I wait in the lobby .
over two hour later ( and ten minute before they close ) my car be finally finish .
a few minute after I leave , I be call and inform that " I " leave my wheel lock ( which they should have leave in the car ) .
of course , they would be close in 5 minute , so I would have to hurry up or get it the next day .
of course I could not make it back in time ( and they apparently could not stay 5 extra minute to wait for I ) .
the next day , no one could find my wheel lock and that particular technician be not in .
of course , they could not call he either to ask about it because apparently they do not keep they employee 's phone number ( riiight ) , so I would have to return on Monday ( drive for 3 day now with no wheel lock should I get a flat ) .
on Monday I call and again it be a big to - do to find anyone who know anything about it .
supposedly they will be hold it for I this evening , but I be sure that will also be a huge ordeal .
the employee at this Sear's be completely apathetic and there do not seem to be any sort of management that I could see .
I will never return there again ( and now have some serious doubt about the quality of work they actually perform on my car ) .
